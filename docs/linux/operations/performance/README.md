# Performance

> **Understanding system performance to optimize Kubernetes workloads.**

## Overview

Performance analysis is more than running `top`. This section teaches systematic approaches to identifying bottlenecks, understanding resource consumption, and optimizing Linux systems—skills essential for Kubernetes operations.

## Modules

| # | Module | Description | Time |
|---|--------|-------------|------|
| 5.1 | [USE Method](module-5.1-use-method.md) | Systematic performance analysis: Utilization, Saturation, Errors | 25-30 min |
| 5.2 | [CPU & Scheduling](module-5.2-cpu-scheduling.md) | CPU utilization, load average, CFS scheduler, priorities | 30-35 min |
| 5.3 | [Memory Management](module-5.3-memory-management.md) | Virtual memory, caching, swap, OOM killer | 30-35 min |
| 5.4 | [I/O Performance](module-5.4-io-performance.md) | Disk I/O, filesystems, block devices, storage tuning | 25-30 min |

## Why This Section Matters

Kubernetes resource management depends on Linux fundamentals:

- **Resource requests/limits** — Based on actual CPU and memory usage
- **Node pressure** — Understanding when nodes are overloaded
- **Pod eviction** — Memory pressure triggers OOM kills
- **Performance debugging** — Slow apps often have OS-level causes

Can't set proper resource limits without understanding what they measure.

## Prerequisites

- [System Essentials](../../foundations/system-essentials/) — Processes and filesystems
- [Container Primitives](../../foundations/container-primitives/) — cgroups and namespaces

## Key Takeaways

After completing this section, you'll understand:

1. How to systematically analyze performance issues
2. What CPU metrics actually mean
3. How Linux manages memory and when it fails
4. How to identify I/O bottlenecks
