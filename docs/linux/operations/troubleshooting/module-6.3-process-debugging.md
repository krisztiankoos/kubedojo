# Module 6.3: Process Debugging

> **Linux Troubleshooting** | Complexity: `[COMPLEX]` | Time: 30-35 min

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module:
- **Required**: [Module 1.2: Processes & Systemd](../../foundations/system-essentials/module-1.2-processes-systemd.md)
- **Required**: [Module 6.2: Log Analysis](module-6.2-log-analysis.md)
- **Helpful**: Understanding of system calls

---

## Why This Module Matters

When logs don't tell the whole story, you need to look deeper. Process debugging lets you see exactly what a program is doing: what files it opens, what system calls it makes, and where it's stuck.

Understanding process debugging helps you:

- **Debug black boxes** — See inside programs without source code
- **Find what's blocking** — Why is this process stuck?
- **Trace failures** — What call failed and why?
- **Understand behavior** — What does this process actually do?

Sometimes the only way to understand a problem is to watch the process in action.

---

## Did You Know?

- **strace intercepts system calls** — Every interaction with the kernel (file I/O, network, process control) goes through system calls. strace shows all of them.

- **/proc is a goldmine** — Every process has a virtual directory under /proc with detailed information: file descriptors, memory maps, environment, limits.

- **Processes have over 400 system calls available** — From `read` and `write` to `clone` and `epoll_wait`. Most programs use only 20-30.

- **strace can slow programs 100x** — The overhead of intercepting every system call is significant. Use selectively in production.

## The /proc Filesystem

### Process Information

```bash
# Every process has a directory
ls /proc/1/  # PID 1 (init/systemd)

# Key files:
# cmdline  - Command and arguments
# cwd      - Current working directory (symlink)
# environ  - Environment variables
# exe      - Executable (symlink)
# fd/      - File descriptors
# limits   - Resource limits
# maps     - Memory mappings
# stat     - Process status
# status   - Human-readable status
```

### Examining a Process

```bash
# Get PID
PID=$(pgrep nginx | head -1)

# Command line
cat /proc/$PID/cmdline | tr '\0' ' '
# nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx

# Working directory
ls -l /proc/$PID/cwd
# lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 15 10:00 /proc/1234/cwd -> /

# Executable
ls -l /proc/$PID/exe
# lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 15 10:00 /proc/1234/exe -> /usr/sbin/nginx

# Environment
cat /proc/$PID/environ | tr '\0' '\n'
# PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:...
# LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

### File Descriptors

```bash
# List open file descriptors
ls -l /proc/$PID/fd/
# lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Jan 15 10:00 0 -> /dev/null
# lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Jan 15 10:00 1 -> /var/log/nginx/access.log
# lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Jan 15 10:00 2 -> /var/log/nginx/error.log
# lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Jan 15 10:00 3 -> socket:[12345]

# Count open files
ls /proc/$PID/fd/ | wc -l

# File descriptor info
cat /proc/$PID/fdinfo/3
# pos:    0
# flags:  02
# mnt_id: 28
```

### Resource Limits

```bash
# View limits
cat /proc/$PID/limits
# Limit                     Soft Limit           Hard Limit           Units
# Max open files            1024                 1048576              files
# Max processes             30000                30000                processes
# Max file size             unlimited            unlimited            bytes
```

### Memory Maps

```bash
# Memory layout
cat /proc/$PID/maps | head -20
# 55d7f8a00000-55d7f8a02000 r--p 00000000 08:01 123456 /usr/sbin/nginx
# 55d7f8a02000-55d7f8a50000 r-xp 00002000 08:01 123456 /usr/sbin/nginx
# 7f8b1234000-7f8b1235000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0      [heap]

# Memory summary
cat /proc/$PID/status | grep -E "VmSize|VmRSS|VmSwap"
# VmSize:   234567 kB
# VmRSS:    12345 kB
# VmSwap:   0 kB
```

---

## strace

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Trace a command
strace ls /tmp
# execve("/bin/ls", ["ls", "/tmp"], 0x7fff...) = 0
# ...
# openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_DIRECTORY) = 3
# ...

# Attach to running process
strace -p 1234

# Detach with Ctrl+C

# Trace with timestamps
strace -t ls /tmp        # HH:MM:SS
strace -tt ls /tmp       # HH:MM:SS.microseconds
strace -r ls /tmp        # Relative time since last call
```

### Filtering System Calls

```bash
# Only file operations
strace -e trace=file ls /tmp

# Only network operations
strace -e trace=network curl google.com

# Only process operations
strace -e trace=process bash -c "ls"

# Categories:
# file    - open, stat, chmod, unlink, rename, ...
# network - socket, connect, accept, send, recv, ...
# process - fork, clone, execve, exit, wait, ...
# signal  - signal, sigaction, kill, ...
# ipc     - shmget, semget, msgget, ...
# memory  - mmap, mprotect, brk, ...

# Specific calls
strace -e open,read,write cat /etc/passwd
```

### Output and Formatting

```bash
# Write to file
strace -o /tmp/trace.log ls /tmp

# Include child processes
strace -f bash -c "ls | grep foo"

# Limit string length (default 32)
strace -s 200 cat /etc/passwd

# Summarize calls
strace -c ls /tmp
# % time     seconds  usecs/call     calls    errors syscall
# ------ ----------- ----------- --------- --------- ----------------
#  40.00    0.000004           4         1           write
#  30.00    0.000003           0        10           read
#  ...

# Print only errors
strace -Z ls /nonexistent 2>&1 | head
```

### Common Patterns

```bash
# What files does it open?
strace -e openat,open ls 2>&1 | grep -v ENOENT

# What's it connecting to?
strace -e connect nginx 2>&1

# Why is it slow?
strace -tt -T curl -s http://example.com 2>&1 | tail
# -T shows time spent in each call

# What config is it reading?
strace -e openat myapp 2>&1 | grep -E "\.conf|\.cfg|\.yaml"
```

## Process States

### Understanding States

```bash
ps aux
# USER  PID %CPU %MEM   VSZ   RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND
# root    1  0.0  0.1 12345  6789 ?   Ss   Jan15 0:01 /sbin/init

# STAT column meanings:
# S  Sleeping (waiting for event)
# R  Running or runnable
# D  Uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O)
# Z  Zombie (finished but not reaped)
# T  Stopped (by signal or debugger)
# I  Idle kernel thread
```

```

```

### Finding Problem States

```bash
# Find D state (stuck in I/O)
ps aux | awk '$8 ~ /D/ {print}'

# Find zombies
ps aux | awk '$8 ~ /Z/ {print}'

# Or
ps -eo pid,ppid,stat,comm | grep -E "^|Z"

# Count by state
ps -eo stat | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

---

## Debugging Stuck Processes

### Process Hanging?

```bash
# 1. Check what state it's in
ps -o pid,stat,wchan -p $PID
# WCHAN = kernel function where it's waiting

# 2. Check what it's waiting for
cat /proc/$PID/stack
# Shows kernel stack trace

# 3. Check open files/sockets
ls -l /proc/$PID/fd/
lsof -p $PID

# 4. Attach strace
sudo strace -p $PID
# See what call it's stuck on
```

### Process Using Too Much CPU?

```bash
# 1. Identify process
top -p $PID

# 2. What's it doing?
strace -c -p $PID
# Ctrl+C after a few seconds
# Shows breakdown of time spent

# 3. Profile (if perf available)
sudo perf top -p $PID
```

### Process Using Too Much Memory?

```bash
# 1. Check memory
cat /proc/$PID/status | grep -E "Vm|Mem"

# 2. Memory map
cat /proc/$PID/smaps_rollup

# 3. Heap analysis (if heap dump supported)
# Depends on application (Java: jmap, Python: tracemalloc)
```

---

## lsof

### List Open Files

```bash
# All open files by process
lsof -p $PID

# Who has a file open?
lsof /var/log/syslog

# Who's using a port?
lsof -i :80

# Network connections
lsof -i -P -n
# -P = numeric ports
# -n = numeric hosts

# Deleted but held files
lsof | grep deleted
# Common cause of "disk full" when df shows space
```

### Common Patterns

```bash
# Files open by user
lsof -u username

# Files in a directory
lsof +D /var/log/

# TCP connections to host
lsof -i @192.168.1.1

# What's preventing unmount?
lsof /mnt/point
```

---

## ltrace

### Library Calls

```bash
# Trace library calls (not system calls)
ltrace ls /tmp

# Output shows:
# strlen("tmp")  = 3
# malloc(4096)   = 0x55555556a2a0
# ...

# Compare with strace
# strace  = kernel interface (syscalls)
# ltrace  = library interface (libc, etc.)

# Filter by library
ltrace -l libc.so.6 ls /tmp
```

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| strace in production | Major performance hit | Use -p briefly, filter with -e |
| Ignoring D state | Process waiting for I/O | Check disk, NFS, network storage |
| Not checking parent | Zombie's parent should reap | Find PPID, fix parent process |
| Missing file descriptors | Process can't open files | Check limits, leaked FDs |
| Over-tracing | Too much output | Filter with -e option |
| Forgetting -f | Miss child processes | Use -f to follow forks |

## Quiz

### Question 1
How do you find what files a process has open?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Multiple ways:

```bash
# 1. /proc filesystem
ls -l /proc/$PID/fd/

# 2. lsof
lsof -p $PID

# 3. strace (for new opens)
strace -e openat -p $PID
```

`/proc/$PID/fd/` is fastest and doesn't affect the process. `lsof` gives more detail. `strace` shows new file operations in real-time.

</details>

### Question 2
What does a 'D' state in `ps` output mean?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Uninterruptible sleep** — the process is waiting for I/O and cannot be interrupted, not even by signals.

Common causes:
- Waiting for disk I/O
- Waiting for NFS or network filesystem
- Hardware problems

Characteristics:
- Cannot be killed with SIGKILL
- Will complete when I/O finishes (or times out)
- Many D state processes = I/O subsystem problem

Check:
```bash
ps aux | awk '$8 ~ /D/'
cat /proc/$PID/stack  # See kernel function
```

</details>

### Question 3
How do you trace only network-related system calls?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

```bash
strace -e trace=network command
```

This traces: socket, bind, connect, listen, accept, send, recv, etc.

For a running process:
```bash
sudo strace -e trace=network -p $PID
```

To see what a program connects to:
```bash
strace -e connect curl http://example.com 2>&1
# Shows: connect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, ...}, 16) = 0
```

</details>

### Question 4
What's the difference between strace and ltrace?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**strace** traces **system calls** — interactions with the kernel:
- File operations (open, read, write)
- Process operations (fork, exec, exit)
- Network (socket, connect, send)
- Low-level, kernel interface

**ltrace** traces **library calls** — interactions with shared libraries:
- libc functions (malloc, printf, strlen)
- Other libraries the program uses
- Higher-level, user-space interface

Example:
- `printf("hello")` calls `write(1, "hello", 5)`
- ltrace shows `printf`, strace shows `write`

Use strace for I/O, network, system behavior. Use ltrace for library-level debugging.

</details>

### Question 5
How do you find why a process is stuck/hanging?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Step by step:

```bash
# 1. Check state
ps -o pid,stat,wchan -p $PID
# STAT tells you state, WCHAN tells kernel function

# 2. Check kernel stack
cat /proc/$PID/stack
# Shows what kernel call it's in

# 3. Attach strace
sudo strace -p $PID
# Shows last/current syscall

# 4. Check what it's waiting on
ls -l /proc/$PID/fd/
lsof -p $PID
# Look for network, disk, locks
```

Common causes:
- D state: I/O (disk, NFS, network storage)
- S state on connect: waiting for network
- S state on flock: waiting for lock
- S state on read from pipe: waiting for input

</details>

## Hands-On Exercise

### Process Debugging Practice

**Objective**: Use /proc, strace, and lsof to examine process behavior.

**Environment**: Linux system with root access

#### Part 1: Exploring /proc

```bash
# 1. Find a process to examine
pgrep -l bash
PID=$(pgrep bash | head -1)
echo "Examining PID: $PID"

# 2. Command line
cat /proc/$PID/cmdline | tr '\0' ' '; echo

# 3. Working directory
ls -l /proc/$PID/cwd

# 4. Executable
ls -l /proc/$PID/exe

# 5. Open file descriptors
ls -l /proc/$PID/fd/

# 6. Environment variables
cat /proc/$PID/environ | tr '\0' '\n' | head -10

# 7. Memory info
cat /proc/$PID/status | grep -E "Vm|Mem"

# 8. Resource limits
cat /proc/$PID/limits | head -10
```

#### Part 2: Basic strace

```bash
# 1. Trace a simple command
strace -c ls /tmp
# Shows summary of syscalls

# 2. Trace with output
strace ls /tmp 2>&1 | head -20

# 3. Trace file operations only
strace -e trace=file ls /tmp 2>&1 | head -20

# 4. Trace with timestamps
strace -tt ls /tmp 2>&1 | head -10

# 5. Trace and time calls
strace -T cat /etc/passwd 2>&1 | tail -10
# -T shows time in each call
```

#### Part 3: strace Filtering

```bash
# 1. What config files does a program read?
strace -e openat cat /etc/passwd 2>&1

# 2. What network calls?
strace -e trace=network curl -s http://example.com 2>&1 | head -20

# 3. Trace child processes
strace -f bash -c "echo hello | cat" 2>&1 | tail -20

# 4. Write to file
strace -o /tmp/trace.log ls /tmp
head -30 /tmp/trace.log
```

#### Part 4: lsof

```bash
# 1. Current shell's open files
lsof -p $$

# 2. What's using port 22? (if sshd running)
sudo lsof -i :22 2>/dev/null | head -10

# 3. Network connections
lsof -i -P -n | head -20

# 4. Files in a directory
lsof +D /var/log/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

#### Part 5: Process States

```bash
# 1. Check process states
ps aux | head -20

# 2. Find any D state (if any)
ps aux | awk '$8 ~ /D/ {print}' || echo "No D state processes"

# 3. Find zombies (if any)
ps aux | awk '$8 ~ /Z/ {print}' || echo "No zombie processes"

# 4. Count by state
ps -eo stat | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# 5. Check your shell's state
ps -o pid,stat,wchan -p $$
```

#### Part 6: Debugging Scenario

```bash
# Create a process to debug
sleep 300 &
SLEEP_PID=$!
echo "Created sleep process: $SLEEP_PID"

# 1. Check state
ps -o pid,stat,wchan -p $SLEEP_PID

# 2. Check what it's doing
cat /proc/$SLEEP_PID/stack 2>/dev/null || echo "Stack not available"

# 3. Attach strace briefly
timeout 2 strace -p $SLEEP_PID 2>&1 || true

# 4. Check open files
ls -l /proc/$SLEEP_PID/fd/

# 5. Clean up
kill $SLEEP_PID
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **/proc has everything** — File descriptors, memory, limits, stack traces

2. **strace shows syscalls** — What the process is actually doing

3. **Filter strace output** — Use `-e trace=` to reduce noise

4. **lsof finds open files** — Including network connections

5. **Process state matters** — D state means I/O, Z means zombie
