# Troubleshooting

> **Systematic approaches to diagnosing Linux problems.**

## Overview

Troubleshooting isn't guesswork—it's methodology. This section teaches systematic approaches to finding root causes, using logs effectively, and debugging at different levels of the stack.

## Modules

| # | Module | Description | Time |
|---|--------|-------------|------|
| 6.1 | [Systematic Troubleshooting](module-6.1-systematic-troubleshooting.md) | Methodologies: hypothesis-driven, divide & conquer, timeline | 25-30 min |
| 6.2 | [Log Analysis](module-6.2-log-analysis.md) | journald, syslog, log patterns, correlation | 25-30 min |
| 6.3 | [Process Debugging](module-6.3-process-debugging.md) | strace, ltrace, /proc, debugging hung processes | 30-35 min |
| 6.4 | [Network Debugging](module-6.4-network-debugging.md) | tcpdump, ss, connectivity issues, DNS problems | 30-35 min |

## Why This Section Matters

Production issues don't come with error messages. Systematic debugging skills help you:

- **Find root causes faster** — Not just symptoms
- **Debug Kubernetes issues** — Many have Linux causes
- **Handle incidents** — Methodical approach reduces MTTR
- **Learn from failures** — Understand what actually happened

## Prerequisites

- [Performance](../performance/) — USE method and metrics
- [Networking](../../foundations/networking/) — TCP/IP and iptables
- [Security Hardening](../../security/hardening/) — SELinux/AppArmor denials

## Key Takeaways

After completing this section, you'll understand:

1. How to approach problems systematically
2. How to use logs effectively
3. How to trace process behavior
4. How to debug network connectivity
