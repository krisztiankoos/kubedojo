# Security Principles

> **Foundation Track** | 4 Modules | ~2 hours total

The mindset and principles of building secure systems. Concepts that apply regardless of which tools, languages, or platforms you use.

---

## Why Security Principles?

Every system you build will be attacked. The question isn't "if" but "when" and "how prepared are you?"

Security principles teach you to:
- **Think** like attackers to defend against them
- **Design** systems that are secure by default
- **Layer** defenses so one failure doesn't mean total compromise
- **Manage** identity and access with least privilege

This isn't about memorizing checklists. It's about developing the security mindset that makes those checklists obvious.

## Key Concepts You'll Learn

| Concept | Module | What It Means |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Attack Surface | 4.1 | Everything an attacker could target |
| Least Privilege | 4.1, 4.3 | Grant minimum necessary permissions |
| Defense in Depth | 4.2 | Layer independent security controls |
| Zero Trust | 4.1, 4.2 | Never trust, always verify |
| Fail Secure | 4.1 | When things fail, fail to secure state |
| Trust Boundary | 4.1 | Where data crosses trust levels |
| Authentication | 4.3 | Proving identity (who are you?) |
| Authorization | 4.3 | Granting access (what can you do?) |
| RBAC | 4.3 | Role-Based Access Control |
| Secure by Default | 4.4 | Security without explicit configuration |
| Guardrails | 4.4 | Constraints that prevent mistakes |
| Immutable Infrastructure | 4.4 | Deploy new, never update in place |

## The Security Mindset

| Question to Ask | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "What could go wrong?" | Threat modeling starts here |
| "Who would want to attack this?" | Determines threat level and investment |
| "What's the blast radius?" | Scopes potential damage |
| "How would we know?" | Detection and monitoring |
| "What's the secure default?" | Security shouldn't require action |
| "What do I implicitly trust?" | Hidden assumptions are vulnerabilities |
