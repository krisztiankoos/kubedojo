**July 2020. Twitter's internal admin tools become a weapon.**

A 17-year-old from Florida convinces Twitter employees to give him access to internal systems through a phone-based social engineering attack. With those credentials, the teenager gains access to Twitter's admin panel—a tool designed for customer support that can take over any account on the platform.

Within hours, the accounts of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Apple, Uber, and dozens of other high-profile users tweet the same message: send Bitcoin to this address and get double back. A classic scam, but with unprecedented reach.

**130 accounts compromised. $120,000 in Bitcoin stolen. Twitter's stock dropped 4% the next day.** But the real damage was reputational—the world saw that Twitter's identity and access controls allowed a teenager with social engineering skills to hijack any account on the platform.

The vulnerability wasn't technical. Twitter had authentication. The problem was authorization: too many employees had access to an admin tool that could control any account. Least privilege wasn't enforced. Access wasn't audited. One compromised credential became god mode.

This module teaches identity and access management—how to authenticate who someone is, authorize what they can do, and ensure the principle of least privilege limits the damage when (not if) credentials are compromised.

---

## Why This Module Matters

Every security incident involves a question: "Who did this?" And every access control decision requires answering: "Should this identity be allowed to do this action on this resource?"

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is the foundation of security. It's how you know who's who, and how you decide who can do what. Get it wrong, and you have either an unusable system (too restrictive) or a compromised one (too permissive).

This module teaches you the principles of authentication (proving identity) and authorization (granting access)—concepts that apply whether you're securing a Kubernetes cluster, a cloud account, or an internal application.

> **The Bouncer Analogy**
>
> A nightclub bouncer does two jobs: check your ID (authentication) and decide if you can enter (authorization). These are different questions. You might have valid ID but not be on the guest list. In systems, authentication proves who you are; authorization decides what you can do.

## Part 1: Authentication Fundamentals

### 1.1 What is Authentication?

```
AUTHENTICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Authentication answers: "WHO ARE YOU?"

It's the process of verifying that someone is who they claim to be.

AUTHENTICATION FLOW
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. CLAIM: "I am alice@example.com"
2. PROOF: Provide password, certificate, or token
3. VERIFY: System checks proof against stored credential
4. RESULT: Authenticated (identity confirmed) or Rejected

WHAT AUTHENTICATION IS NOT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✗ Deciding what the user can do (that's authorization)
✗ Tracking what the user did (that's auditing)
✗ Protecting the communication (that's encryption)

Authentication just answers: "Is this really Alice?"
```

### 1.2 Authentication Factors

```
THE THREE AUTHENTICATION FACTORS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SOMETHING YOU KNOW
    Password, PIN, security questions

    + Easy to implement
    - Can be guessed, phished, stolen
    - Users pick weak passwords, reuse them

SOMETHING YOU HAVE
    Phone (SMS, TOTP), hardware key (YubiKey), smart card

    + Harder to steal remotely
    + Proves physical possession
    - Can be lost, stolen, SIM-swapped
    - Requires user to carry device

SOMETHING YOU ARE
    Fingerprint, face, retina, voice

    + Always with you
    + Hard to forge (for now)
    - Can't be changed if compromised
    - Privacy concerns
    - False positives/negatives

MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Combines two or more factors:

    Password (know) + TOTP (have) = Much stronger

    Attacker needs to compromise BOTH factors,
    which requires different attack techniques.
```

### 1.3 Authentication Methods

| Method | Factor | Security | Usability |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Password** | Know | Low (if weak) | High |
| **Password + TOTP** | Know + Have | Medium-High | Medium |
| **Password + Hardware Key** | Know + Have | High | Medium |
| **Certificate (mTLS)** | Have | High | Low (complex setup) |
| **SSO/OIDC** | Delegated | Depends on IdP | High |
| **Passwordless (WebAuthn)** | Have | High | Medium-High |

## Part 2: Authorization Fundamentals

### 2.1 What is Authorization?

```
AUTHORIZATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Authorization answers: "WHAT CAN YOU DO?"

After authentication confirms identity, authorization decides
what that identity is allowed to access.

AUTHORIZATION DECISION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
INPUTS:
    - WHO: Authenticated identity (alice@example.com)
    - WHAT: Requested action (read, write, delete)
    - WHICH: Target resource (/api/users/123)
    - CONTEXT: Additional factors (time, location, risk)

OUTPUT:
    - ALLOW: Proceed with action
    - DENY: Block action

EXAMPLE:
    Alice requests DELETE /api/users/123

    Check: Does Alice have permission to delete users?
    Check: Can Alice delete this specific user (123)?

    Result: ALLOW or DENY
```

### 2.2 Authorization Models

```
AUTHORIZATION MODELS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ACCESS CONTROL LIST (ACL)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Permissions attached directly to resources.

    /api/users:
        alice: read, write
        bob: read
        carol: read, write, delete

    Simple, but doesn't scale. Managing permissions on
    thousands of resources is unwieldy.

ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Users assigned to roles, roles have permissions.

    Roles:
        viewer: read
        editor: read, write
        admin: read, write, delete

    Assignments:
        alice → editor
        bob → viewer
        carol → admin

    Scales better. Change role, all users update.

ATTRIBUTE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (ABAC)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Policies evaluate attributes of user, resource, context.

    Policy: "Allow if user.department == resource.owner.department
             AND time.hour >= 9 AND time.hour < 17"

    Very flexible. Can express complex rules.
    Can become hard to understand and audit.
```

### 2.3 RBAC in Practice

```
RBAC DESIGN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

KUBERNETES RBAC EXAMPLE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Define what actions are allowed (Role)
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
  namespace: production
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]

# Bind role to identity (RoleBinding)
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: production
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: alice
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

RESULT: Alice can read pods in production namespace.
        Alice cannot write pods.
        Alice cannot read pods in other namespaces.
```

## Part 3: The Principle of Least Privilege

### 3.1 What is Least Privilege?

```
PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Grant only the minimum permissions necessary to perform
the required function—no more, no less.

WHY IT MATTERS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Compromised Identity:
    Without least privilege: Attacker has broad access
    With least privilege: Attacker access is limited

Accidents:
    Without least privilege: Mistake can affect anything
    With least privilege: Mistake limited to allowed scope

Insider Threats:
    Without least privilege: Employees can access anything
    With least privilege: Access only what job requires
```

### 3.2 Implementing Least Privilege

```
LEAST PRIVILEGE IMPLEMENTATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. START WITH ZERO
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Default deny. No permissions until explicitly granted.

    Bad:  New user → Admin role (convenient!)
    Good: New user → No roles → Request needed access

2. SCOPE PERMISSIONS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Narrow by action, resource, and context.

    Too broad: "admin" (can do anything)
    Better: "editor" (can read and write)
    Best: "orders-editor" (can edit orders only)

3. TIME-BOUND ACCESS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Temporary elevated permissions for specific tasks.

    Permanent: alice always has production access
    Time-bound: alice gets production access for 4 hours
                to debug specific issue, then revoked

4. SEPARATE CONCERNS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Different roles for different functions.

    Bad:  One service account for everything
    Good: Separate accounts for app, monitoring, backup
          Each with only its required permissions
```

### 3.3 Common Violations

| Violation | Risk | Fix |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Everyone is admin | No accountability, full blast radius | Role-based access |
| Shared credentials | Can't attribute actions | Individual accounts |
| Permanent elevated access | Ongoing exposure | Just-in-time access |
| Over-provisioned service accounts | Broad access on compromise | Minimal permissions per service |
| Forgotten accounts | Dormant attack vector | Regular access reviews |

> **War Story: The $4.2 Million CI/CD Catastrophe**
>
> **March 2021.** A fast-growing e-commerce company gave their CI/CD pipeline broad Kubernetes admin access. "It needs to deploy, and sometimes fix things," the DevOps lead explained. The permissions had accumulated over two years of "just add this one thing."
>
> A junior engineer submitted a pull request to update deployment scripts. A typo changed `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` to `kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml`. Code review missed it—the change looked small. CI/CD merged and ran the script.
>
> **In 47 seconds, the pipeline deleted 23 production services, 3 databases, and 2 years of customer order history.**
>
> The team had backups, but restoration took 14 hours. The outage occurred on the second-busiest sales day of the quarter. **Total impact: $4.2 million in lost sales plus $800,000 in emergency recovery costs.**
>
> Post-incident analysis revealed the pipeline had permissions to delete any resource in any namespace—permissions it had never legitimately needed. After the incident, they implemented least privilege: CI/CD can create and update deployments in specific namespaces. It cannot delete. It cannot access databases. It cannot modify networking or RBAC.
>
> The recovery took 14 hours. Implementing least privilege took 6 hours. They wished they'd done it first.

## Part 4: Token-Based Authentication

### 4.1 How Tokens Work

```
TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TRADITIONAL (Session-based)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. User logs in
2. Server creates session, stores in database
3. Server sends session ID (cookie)
4. Client sends session ID with each request
5. Server looks up session in database

    Problem: Stateful. Server must store sessions.
    Problem: Doesn't scale well across servers.

TOKEN-BASED (Stateless)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. User logs in
2. Server creates signed token (JWT)
3. Server sends token to client
4. Client sends token with each request
5. Server validates signature, reads claims

    Benefit: Stateless. No session storage.
    Benefit: Scales easily. Any server can validate.
    Benefit: Can include claims (roles, permissions).
```

### 4.2 JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

```
JWT STRUCTURE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Three parts, base64-encoded, separated by dots:

HEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATURE

HEADER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
{
  "alg": "RS256",    // Signing algorithm
  "typ": "JWT"       // Token type
}

PAYLOAD (Claims)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
{
  "sub": "alice@example.com",  // Subject (who)
  "aud": "api.example.com",    // Audience (for whom)
  "iat": 1700000000,           // Issued at
  "exp": 1700003600,           // Expires at
  "roles": ["editor"]          // Custom claims
}

SIGNATURE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
HMAC-SHA256 or RSA signature of header + payload.
Server verifies signature to ensure token wasn't tampered.

CRITICAL: Never trust claims without verifying signature!
```

## Part 5: Service Identity

### 5.1 Machine-to-Machine Authentication

```
SERVICE AUTHENTICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HUMANS                              SERVICES
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Password + MFA                      API Keys
Interactive login                   Automated, non-interactive
One person, many sessions           One service, many instances
Can verify manually                 Must be automated

SERVICE AUTHENTICATION METHODS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

API KEYS
    Long-lived secret string
    Simple but risky if leaked
    Hard to rotate across many instances

CLIENT CERTIFICATES (mTLS)
    Cryptographic identity
    Strong, hard to steal
    Complex PKI management

SHORT-LIVED TOKENS
    Get token from identity provider
    Token expires quickly (hours)
    Even if leaked, limited window

    Kubernetes: ServiceAccount tokens
    AWS: IAM roles for pods (IRSA)
    Cloud: Workload identity
```

### 5.2 Kubernetes Service Accounts

```yaml
# Service Account with minimal permissions
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: production
---
# Role with only needed permissions
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1

  namespace: production
spec:
  serviceAccountName: my-app
  automountServiceAccountToken: true  # Only if needed!
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myapp:v1
```

### 5.3 Workload Identity

```
WORKLOAD IDENTITY (Cloud-Native)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Problem: How do pods authenticate to cloud services?

OLD WAY (Static credentials)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pod has AWS access key stored as secret
    - Long-lived credentials
    - If leaked, attacker has cloud access
    - Hard to rotate across pods

NEW WAY (Workload Identity)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pod gets temporary cloud credentials via Kubernetes identity

## Did You Know?

- **OAuth was invented in 2006** by Blaine Cook while building Twitter's API. He needed a way to let third-party apps post tweets without giving them user passwords.

- **TOTP codes change every 30 seconds** by design. The server and your phone share a secret; both compute HMAC(secret, time/30). Same algorithm, same result, no communication needed.

- **Kubernetes defaulted to auto-mounting service account tokens** until v1.24. Now you have to explicitly request it, implementing least privilege by default.

- **Password complexity rules often backfire.** NIST's 2017 guidelines reversed decades of advice—they now recommend long passphrases over complex passwords, and explicitly discourage mandatory rotation. "Tr0ub4dor&3" is weaker than "correct horse battery staple" because the complex password is hard for humans but easy for computers to crack.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Same password everywhere | One breach compromises all | Unique passwords + password manager |
| No MFA on critical systems | Single factor easily bypassed | MFA everywhere possible |
| Overly broad roles | More access than needed | Granular, purpose-specific roles |
| Long-lived tokens | Large exposure window if leaked | Short-lived tokens, refresh flow |
| Shared service accounts | Can't attribute actions | One account per service |
| No access review | Permissions accumulate | Regular audits, remove unused |

---

## Quiz

1. **What's the difference between authentication and authorization?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   **Authentication** answers "Who are you?" — It verifies the claimed identity by checking proof (password, certificate, token).

   **Authorization** answers "What can you do?" — It determines whether the authenticated identity is allowed to perform a specific action on a specific resource.

   They're sequential: You must authenticate (prove identity) before authorization (check permissions). A valid identity doesn't automatically mean access is granted.

   Example: Alice authenticates with password+MFA. She's confirmed as Alice. Then authorization checks: Can Alice delete this file? Maybe yes, maybe no—depends on her permissions.
   </details>

2. **Why is multi-factor authentication more secure than single factor?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   MFA requires multiple independent proofs of identity from different factor categories:
   - Something you know (password)
   - Something you have (phone, hardware key)
   - Something you are (biometrics)

   An attacker must compromise ALL factors to succeed. Different factors require different attack techniques:
   - Passwords: Phishing, guessing, database breaches
   - TOTP: Device theft, SIM swapping
   - Hardware keys: Physical theft

   Single factor: Attacker needs one technique.
   Multi-factor: Attacker needs multiple different techniques simultaneously.

   The probability of successful attack drops significantly with each factor added.
   </details>

3. **What is the principle of least privilege and how do you implement it?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   **Least privilege**: Grant only the minimum permissions necessary to perform a required function.

   Implementation:
   1. **Default deny**: Start with no permissions; add only what's needed
   2. **Scope narrowly**: Limit by action (read vs write), resource (specific items), context (time, location)
   3. **Use roles**: Group related permissions, assign roles instead of individual permissions
   4. **Time-bound access**: Grant elevated access temporarily, not permanently
   5. **Separate concerns**: Different accounts for different functions
   6. **Regular review**: Audit permissions, remove unused access

   Example: A deployment service doesn't need to delete production databases. Grant only deploy permissions.
   </details>

4. **Why are short-lived tokens preferred over long-lived credentials?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   Short-lived tokens limit exposure:

   **Long-lived credentials** (API keys, passwords):
   - If stolen, attacker has access until key is rotated
   - May never be discovered as stolen
   - Hard to rotate across many systems
   - Exposure window: unlimited

   **Short-lived tokens** (JWT, OAuth tokens):
   - Expire automatically (minutes to hours)
   - If stolen, attacker has limited time window
   - New tokens issued regularly
   - Exposure window: token lifetime only

   Even if an attacker gets a short-lived token, they have hours, not forever. Regular token refresh also forces re-authentication, catching revoked access.
   </details>

5. **A company has 500 employees and 50 applications. Using ACLs, how many permission entries might be needed? How does RBAC reduce this?**
   <details>

   **ACL approach (user-to-resource):**

   If each user might need different permissions on each application:
   - Worst case: 500 users × 50 apps = 25,000 permission entries
   - Each user has a list of permissions for each app
   - When a user's role changes, update up to 50 entries

   **RBAC approach (user-to-role, role-to-permission):**

   Define roles that map to job functions:
   - 10 roles (developer, tester, manager, admin, etc.)
   - 500 user-to-role mappings (one per user)
   - 50 role-to-app permission sets (10 roles × 5 permission levels)
   - Total: ~550 entries vs 25,000

   When a user's job changes:
   - ACL: Update 50 app permissions
   - RBAC: Change 1 role assignment

   RBAC scales because permission logic is centralized in roles, not duplicated per user.

6. **In the Twitter 2020 breach, attackers used social engineering to get employee credentials. What IAM controls would have limited the damage even after credentials were compromised?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   Several controls could have limited blast radius:

   1. **Least privilege**: Admin tool access shouldn't include all accounts. Tiered access: support staff access regular accounts, elevated approval required for verified accounts, senior approval for high-profile accounts.

   2. **Just-in-time access**: Instead of permanent admin access, require requesting elevated permissions for specific actions, with automatic expiration.

   3. **Multi-person authorization**: Actions on high-profile accounts require approval from multiple people (two-person rule).

   4. **Anomaly detection**: Alert on unusual patterns—same user accessing many high-profile accounts rapidly is not normal support behavior.

   5. **Session controls**: Admin sessions timeout quickly. Compromised credentials can't be used indefinitely.

   6. **Separate authentication for sensitive actions**: Even with valid session, require re-authentication for account takeover actions.

   The attack succeeded not because authentication failed, but because authorization was too broad and no controls existed for sensitive actions.

7. **A JWT token has `exp: 1700003600` (Unix timestamp). It's currently `1700000000`. How long until the token expires? What happens if an attacker steals this token?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   **Time until expiration:**

   1700003600 - 1700000000 = 3600 seconds = **1 hour**

   **If attacker steals the token:**

   1. **Attacker can use the token** for up to 1 hour (until expiration)

   2. **Attacker gets the same permissions** as the legitimate user for that time window

   3. **Server cannot detect the theft** from the token alone—it's a valid, unexpired token

   4. **After 1 hour, token becomes useless**—attacker must steal a new one

   **Mitigations:**

   - Shorter expiration times reduce exposure window (trade-off: more frequent refresh)
   - Token binding: tie token to IP, device fingerprint (breaks if these change)
   - Refresh token rotation: each refresh invalidates the old refresh token
   - Anomaly detection: alert on tokens used from unusual locations/patterns
   - Token revocation list: check if token is explicitly revoked (adds server-side state)

   Short-lived tokens don't prevent theft, but they limit the damage window.

8. **A Kubernetes ServiceAccount has `automountServiceAccountToken: true`. Why is this often a security risk, and when should it be disabled?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   **The risk:**

   When `automountServiceAccountToken: true`, the pod automatically receives a token that can authenticate to the Kubernetes API server. If the pod is compromised, the attacker gets this token and can:

   1. Query the API server for cluster information
   2. Access any resources the ServiceAccount is authorized to access
   3. Potentially escalate privileges if the ServiceAccount has broad permissions

   **When to disable:**

   Disable when the application doesn't need to interact with the Kubernetes API:
   - Web servers serving static content
   - Databases
   - Most application workloads

   **When to enable (carefully):**

   Enable only when the application legitimately needs API access:
   - Operators that manage Kubernetes resources
   - Controllers that watch for changes
   - Applications that read ConfigMaps dynamically

   **Best practice:**

   ```yaml
   spec:
     serviceAccountName: my-minimal-sa  # Use dedicated SA
     automountServiceAccountToken: false  # Disable by default
   ```

   If API access is needed, create a ServiceAccount with minimal RBAC permissions and explicitly mount only in pods that need it.

## Hands-On Exercise

**Task**: Design an IAM strategy for a microservices application.

**Scenario**: You're building an e-commerce platform with:
- Web frontend (user-facing)
- API gateway
- Order service
- Inventory service
- Payment service
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache

**Part 1: User Authentication (10 minutes)**

Design the user authentication flow:

| Component | Authentication Method | Factors |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Web login | | |
| API access | | |
| Admin panel | | |

**Part 2: Service Authorization (10 minutes)**

Design service-to-service permissions:

| Service | Can Access | Permissions | Cannot Access |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| API Gateway | Order Service | read, write | |
| Order Service | | | |
| Inventory Service | | | |
| Payment Service | | | |

**Part 3: Database Access (10 minutes)**

Design database access:

| Service | Database Access | Tables | Operations |
|---------|-----------------|--------|------------|
| Order Service | PostgreSQL | orders, order_items | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Part 4: Kubernetes RBAC (10 minutes)**

Write a ServiceAccount and Role for the Order Service:

```yaml
# Your YAML here
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] User auth uses MFA for sensitive operations
- [ ] Each service has only permissions it needs
- [ ] No service has more database access than required
- [ ] RBAC follows least privilege

## Key Takeaways Checklist

Before moving on, verify you can answer these:

- [ ] Can you explain the difference between authentication (who are you?) and authorization (what can you do?)?
- [ ] Can you describe the three authentication factors and why MFA combining them is stronger?
- [ ] Do you understand RBAC vs ACL and why RBAC scales better for organizations?
- [ ] Can you implement the principle of least privilege (default deny, scope narrowly, time-bound)?
- [ ] Do you understand JWT structure and why short-lived tokens limit exposure?
- [ ] Can you explain OAuth 2.0 / OIDC flows and when to use them?
- [ ] Do you understand Kubernetes ServiceAccounts and when to disable `automountServiceAccountToken`?
- [ ] Can you explain workload identity and why it's better than static cloud credentials?
