## Why This Module Matters

Every system you build will be attacked. Not might be—will be. The question isn't "if" but "when" and "how prepared are you?"

Security isn't a feature you add at the end. It's a way of thinking—a mindset that influences every design decision, every line of code, every operational process. Developers who understand security build better systems, even when they're not explicitly "doing security work."

This module introduces the security mindset: how attackers think, how defenders must think, and why security is everyone's responsibility.

> **The Castle Analogy**
>
> Medieval castles weren't just walls. They had moats, drawbridges, murder holes, multiple walls, keeps, and escape routes. Each layer assumed the previous one might fail. The architects thought like attackers: "If I breach the outer wall, what stops me next?" Security engineering is the same: assume breach, plan for failure, layer defenses.

## Part 1: Thinking Like an Attacker

### 1.1 The Attacker's Advantage

```
THE ASYMMETRY OF SECURITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DEFENDER                           ATTACKER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Must protect everything    vs.     Only needs one way in
Must be right every time   vs.     Only needs to be right once
Works within constraints   vs.     No rules, no ethics
Limited budget            vs.      Can be well-funded (or automated)
Must balance usability    vs.      Doesn't care about UX

The attacker chooses:
- WHEN to attack (wait for weekends, holidays)
- WHERE to attack (weakest point)
- HOW to attack (known or novel technique)

The defender must be ready always, everywhere, for everything.
```

### 1.2 The Attack Surface

Your **attack surface** is everything an attacker could potentially target:

```
ATTACK SURFACE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXTERNAL SURFACE (Internet-facing)
├── Web applications
├── APIs
├── DNS
├── Email servers
├── VPN endpoints
└── Any public IP

INTERNAL SURFACE (assumes breach)
├── Internal services
├── Databases
├── Message queues
├── Admin interfaces
└── Developer machines

HUMAN SURFACE
├── Employees (phishing)
├── Contractors
├── Support staff (social engineering)
└── Executives (whale phishing)

SUPPLY CHAIN SURFACE
├── Third-party libraries
├── CI/CD pipeline
├── Build systems
└── Dependencies' dependencies
```

> **Try This (2 minutes)**
>
> List 5 things in your system that could be attacked:
> 1. ____________________
> 2. ____________________
> 3. ____________________
> 4. ____________________
> 5. ____________________
>
> Now think: which one would YOU attack if you were malicious?

### 1.3 Attacker Motivation

Not all attackers want the same thing:

| Attacker Type | Motivation | Targets | Sophistication |
|---------------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Script Kiddies** | Fun, bragging rights | Easy targets | Low |
| **Hacktivists** | Political/social cause | Symbolic targets | Low-Medium |
| **Criminals** | Money | Valuable data, ransomware | Medium-High |
| **Competitors** | Business advantage | Trade secrets | Medium |
| **Nation-states** | Intelligence, disruption | Critical infrastructure | Very High |
| **Insiders** | Revenge, money | Whatever they can access | Varies |

```
THREAT MODELING QUESTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

"Who would want to attack us, and why?"

Small e-commerce site:
    - Criminals (credit card data)
    - Script kiddies (defacement)

Healthcare company:
    - Criminals (medical records worth more than credit cards)
    - Nation-states (intelligence)

Defense contractor:
    - Nation-states (classified information)
    - Competitors (bid information)

Your threat model determines your security investment.
```

## Part 2: Security Principles

### 2.1 Principle of Least Privilege

Grant only the minimum permissions necessary to perform a function.

```
LEAST PRIVILEGE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BAD: Application runs as root, has admin database access
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Web App (root)                                             │
│      │                                                      │
│      └──▶ Database (admin user)                            │
│           - Can read all tables                             │
│           - Can write all tables                            │
│           - Can drop tables                                 │
│           - Can create users                                │
│                                                             │
│  If compromised: attacker owns everything                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

GOOD: Application runs as limited user, minimal DB access
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Web App (app-user)                                         │
│      │                                                      │
│      └──▶ Database (api-readonly on most, write on some)   │
│           - Can read: products, categories                  │
│           - Can write: orders, cart                         │
│           - Cannot: drop, create users, access admin tables │
│                                                             │
│  If compromised: attacker has limited access                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Defense in Depth

Never rely on a single security control. Layer defenses.

```
DEFENSE IN DEPTH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SINGLE LAYER (fragile)
                ┌─────────────┐
Internet ───▶   │  Firewall   │  ───▶  Everything else
                └─────────────┘
                      │
               If firewall fails,
               everything is exposed

MULTIPLE LAYERS (robust)
    ┌─────────────┐
    │  Firewall   │    ← Network layer
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │     WAF     │    ← Application layer
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │ Auth/AuthZ  │    ← Identity layer
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │Input Valid. │    ← Data layer
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │  Encryption │    ← Storage layer
    └─────────────┘

Each layer assumes the previous one might fail.
```

### 2.3 Zero Trust

Never trust, always verify. Assume the network is compromised.

```
TRADITIONAL (PERIMETER) MODEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    Outside         │         Inside (trusted)
    (untrusted)     │
                    │
    ┌─────┐         │    ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐
    │Attacker│──X───│    │App A│◀──▶│App B│◀──▶│ DB  │
    └─────┘    │    │    └─────┘    └─────┘    └─────┘
               ▼    │
          [Firewall]│    "If you're inside, you're trusted"
                    │
                    │    Problem: Once inside, attacker moves freely

ZERO TRUST MODEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Every request is verified, regardless of source:

    ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐
    │App A│──auth──▶│App B│──auth──▶│ DB  │
    └─────┘         └─────┘         └─────┘
       │               │               │
       └───────────────┴───────────────┘
                       │
              Every call authenticated
              Every action authorized
              Every connection encrypted

    "Never trust, always verify"
```

### 2.4 Fail Secure

When something fails, fail to a secure state, not an open one.

```
FAIL SECURE vs FAIL OPEN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FAIL OPEN (dangerous)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Auth service down → Allow all requests (so users aren't blocked)
    Result: Attacker can bypass authentication

Validation error → Skip validation (so it doesn't crash)
    Result: Malicious input gets through

FAIL SECURE (correct)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Auth service down → Deny all requests
    Result: Users inconvenienced, but system secure

Validation error → Reject the request
    Result: Legitimate requests might fail, but attacks blocked

The secure default is always to deny.
```

> **Try This (2 minutes)**
>
> For each scenario, which is the secure default?
>
> | Scenario | Fail Open | Fail Secure |
> |----------|-----------|-------------|
> | Firewall crashes | Allow traffic | Block traffic |
> | Permission check fails | Grant access | Deny access |
> | Rate limiter errors | Allow requests | Block requests |
> | Certificate validation fails | Allow connection | Reject connection |
>
> (All should be "Fail Secure")

## Part 3: Security vs. Security Theater

### 3.1 What is Security Theater?

**Security theater** is measures that provide the feeling of security without actually improving it.

```
SECURITY THEATER EXAMPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PASSWORDS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Theater: Requiring password changes every 30 days
    Result: Users pick weak passwords with incrementing numbers
    Real security: Long passphrases + MFA

COMPLIANCE CHECKBOXES
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Theater: "We passed the audit"
    Result: Checked boxes, but real vulnerabilities remain
    Real security: Continuous security testing

NETWORK SECURITY
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Theater: "We have a firewall"
    Result: Firewall exists but rules are too permissive
    Real security: Properly configured, monitored firewall

ENCRYPTION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Theater: "We encrypt everything"
    Result: Encryption at rest, but keys stored next to data
    Real security: Proper key management, encryption in transit too
```

### 3.2 How to Spot Security Theater

| Real Security | Security Theater |
|---------------|------------------|
| Reduces actual risk | Reduces perceived risk |
| Based on threat modeling | Based on compliance checkboxes |
| Measured by outcomes | Measured by presence |
| Evolves with threats | Static, set-and-forget |
| Tested regularly | Assumed to work |

### 3.3 The Security vs. Usability Trade-off

```
THE SECURITY-USABILITY SPECTRUM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HIGH SECURITY, LOW USABILITY
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  - Air-gapped systems                                       │
│  - Multi-person authorization for everything                │
│  - Physical presence required                               │
│  - No remote access                                         │
│                                                             │
│  Result: Very secure, but hard to use                      │
│  Risk: Users find workarounds (sticky note passwords)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

LOW SECURITY, HIGH USABILITY
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  - No passwords                                             │
│  - Everyone is admin                                        │
│  - No audit logs                                            │
│                                                             │
│  Result: Easy to use, but trivially compromised            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

THE GOAL: Maximum security at acceptable usability
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  - SSO (one login for everything)                          │
│  - MFA that's not annoying (push notifications)            │
│  - Role-based access (right permissions automatically)     │
│  - Security that's invisible when not needed               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> **War Story: The Firewall That Wasn't**
>
> A company bragged about their "enterprise firewall." During a penetration test, the testers found the firewall had an "allow all" rule because, over years of "just this one exception," it had accumulated so many holes that someone gave up and opened everything.
>
> The firewall dashboard showed green. Monthly reports said "protected." But the security was entirely theater—a expensive box that did nothing.
>
> Real security isn't about having tools. It's about using them correctly.

## Part 4: Trust and Verification

### 4.1 The Problem with Trust

```
TRUST IS A VULNERABILITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Every time you trust something, you create a potential attack vector:

"We trust our employees"
    → Insider threat, compromised credentials

"We trust our vendors"
    → Supply chain attacks (SolarWinds)

"We trust our internal network"
    → Lateral movement after initial breach

"We trust this library"
    → Malicious package, dependency confusion

"We trust input from our mobile app"
    → App can be reverse-engineered, requests forged

Trust should be:
- Explicit (documented what you trust and why)
- Minimal (trust as little as possible)
- Verified (check that trust is warranted)
- Revocable (can remove trust quickly)
```

### 4.2 Trust Boundaries

A **trust boundary** is where data or execution crosses between different trust levels.

```
TRUST BOUNDARIES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

         UNTRUSTED           │         TRUSTED
                             │
    ┌──────────────┐         │
    │   Internet   │         │
    │              │─────────┼───▶ VALIDATE HERE
    │  User input  │         │
    │  API calls   │    Trust boundary
    │  Webhooks    │         │
    └──────────────┘         │

                             │
    ┌──────────────┐         │
    │  Third-party │         │
    │   services   │─────────┼───▶ VALIDATE HERE
    │              │         │
    └──────────────┘    Trust boundary
                             │

Every trust boundary needs:
- Input validation
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Rate limiting
- Logging
```

### 4.3 Verification Techniques

| What to Verify | Technique |
|----------------|-----------|
| User identity | Authentication (passwords, MFA, certificates) |
| User permissions | Authorization (RBAC, ABAC, policies) |
| Data integrity | Checksums, signatures, MACs |
| Data source | Digital signatures, certificate pinning |
| Code integrity | Code signing, reproducible builds |
| Request legitimacy | CSRF tokens, nonces, timestamps |

> **Try This (3 minutes)**
>
> Draw the trust boundaries in your system:
>
> 1. Where does untrusted data enter?
> 2. What do you implicitly trust that you shouldn't?
> 3. Where are you NOT validating input?

## Part 5: Building Security In

### 5.1 Shift Left

```
SECURITY IN THE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TRADITIONAL (security at the end)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 5.2 Secure Development Practices

| Practice | What It Does | When |
|----------|--------------|------|
| **Threat modeling** | Identify what could go wrong | Design phase |
| **Secure coding standards** | Prevent common vulnerabilities | Coding |
| **Code review** | Human review for security issues | Before merge |
| **SAST** | Static analysis for vulnerabilities | CI pipeline |
| **DAST** | Dynamic testing of running app | Staging/Prod |
| **Dependency scanning** | Check for vulnerable libraries | CI pipeline |
| **Secret scanning** | Prevent credential leaks | Pre-commit, CI |
| **Penetration testing** | Find what automation misses | Periodically |

### 5.3 Security as Culture

```
SECURITY CULTURE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BAD CULTURE                          GOOD CULTURE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"Security is the security team's    "Security is everyone's job"
 problem"

"We'll add security later"           "We design for security"

"That's too paranoid"                "What's the threat model?"

"It's just internal, doesn't        "All data deserves protection"
 matter"

"Nobody would do that"               "Assume attackers are smart
                                      and motivated"

"We've never been hacked"            "We haven't detected a hack"
```

---

## Did You Know?

- **The term "hacker"** originally meant someone who explored systems creatively. The malicious meaning came later. "Cracker" was the original term for malicious hackers, but media conflation made "hacker" the common term.

- **The first computer virus** (Creeper, 1971) wasn't malicious—it just displayed "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can." The first antivirus (Reaper) was written to delete it.

- **Social engineering** accounts for over 90% of successful attacks. Technical defenses matter less than training humans to recognize manipulation.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Security as afterthought | Expensive to retrofit | Shift left, threat model early |
| Trusting the network | Lateral movement after breach | Zero trust architecture |
| Assuming perimeter is enough | Insiders, supply chain | Defense in depth |
| Security through obscurity | Attackers will figure it out | Assume your code is public |
| Ignoring usability | Users bypass security | Make security easy |
| One-time security review | Security degrades over time | Continuous security |

## Quiz

1. **Why do attackers have an inherent advantage over defenders?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   Attackers have structural advantages:

   1. **Asymmetry of focus**: Defenders must protect everything; attackers only need one vulnerability
   2. **Asymmetry of success**: Defenders must be right every time; attackers only need to succeed once
   3. **No constraints**: Attackers don't have budgets, ethics, or usability requirements
   4. **Initiative**: Attackers choose when, where, and how to attack
   5. **Patience**: Attackers can wait for the right moment (holidays, key personnel away)

   This asymmetry is why defense in depth is essential—no single control will always work.
   </details>

2. **What is the principle of least privilege and why does it matter?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   **Least privilege**: Grant only the minimum permissions necessary to perform a function.

   Why it matters:
   1. **Limits blast radius**: Compromised component can only do what it's authorized to do
   2. **Reduces accident damage**: Mistakes can't affect systems the user doesn't have access to
   3. **Simplifies auditing**: Fewer permissions to review and track
   4. **Contains insider threats**: Malicious employees have limited reach

   Example: A web application that only reads products should have read-only database access. If compromised, the attacker can't modify or delete data.
   </details>

3. **What's the difference between security and security theater?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   **Security** actually reduces risk through effective controls.

   **Security theater** creates the appearance of security without substantive risk reduction.

   How to distinguish:
   - Security is based on threat modeling; theater is based on compliance checkboxes
   - Security is measured by outcomes; theater is measured by presence of controls
   - Security evolves with threats; theater is static
   - Security is tested; theater is assumed to work

   Example: A firewall is security. An improperly configured firewall with "allow all" rules is security theater—it exists but provides no protection.
   </details>

4. **Why is "shift left" important for security?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   "Shift left" means integrating security earlier in the development lifecycle.

   Why it matters:
   1. **Cost**: Security issues found in production cost 100x more to fix than in design
   2. **Time**: Fixing security late delays releases
   3. **Quality**: Security-conscious design is fundamentally better design
   4. **Coverage**: Automated security checks in CI catch issues before humans would

   Traditional: Security review happens at the end (if at all)
   Shift left: Threat modeling in design, secure coding practices, automated scanning in CI, regular penetration testing

   Finding a SQL injection in code review costs minutes. Finding it in production costs days plus breach response.
   </details>

## Hands-On Exercise

**Task**: Perform a mini threat model for a web application.

**Scenario**: You're building a simple e-commerce site with:
- User registration and login
- Product catalog
- Shopping cart
- Checkout with credit card processing

**Part 1: Identify Assets (5 minutes)**

What data/capabilities does an attacker want?

| Asset | Value to Attacker |
|-------|-------------------|
| User credentials | |
| Credit card numbers | |
| Customer PII | |
