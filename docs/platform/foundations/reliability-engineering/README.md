# Reliability Engineering

> **Foundation Track** | 4 Modules | ~2 hours total

The engineering discipline of building systems that work when users need them. Theory and principles that apply regardless of your tech stack.

---

## Why Reliability Engineering?

Users don't care about your architecture. They care about one thing: **does it work?**

Reliability engineering teaches you to:
- **Define** what "reliable" means for your context
- **Measure** reliability objectively
- **Design** for failure before it happens
- **Improve** continuously through data-driven decisions

This isn't about hoping things don't break. It's about engineering systems that survive when they do.

## Key Concepts You'll Learn

| Concept | Module | What It Means |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| The Nines | 2.1 | 99.9% vs 99.99% = 10x difference in allowed downtime |
| MTBF/MTTR | 2.1 | Mean time between failures / to recovery |
| Error Budget | 2.1, 2.4 | Acceptable unreliability as a resource to spend |
| FMEA | 2.2 | Systematic technique for predicting failures |
| Graceful Degradation | 2.2 | Partial functionality better than total failure |
| Blast Radius | 2.2 | Scope of impact when something fails |
| Bulkhead Pattern | 2.2, 2.3 | Isolation to prevent cascading failures |
| High Availability | 2.3 | System stays operational with minimal downtime |
| Fault Tolerance | 2.3 | System continues without any interruption |
| SLI/SLO/SLA | 2.4 | Indicator/Objective/Agreement framework |
