# Observability Theory

> **Foundation Track** | 4 Modules | ~2 hours total

The science of understanding system behavior from external outputs. Theory and principles that apply regardless of which tools you use.

## Why Observability Theory?

You can't fix what you can't see. But observability is more than just seeing—it's about **understanding**.

Observability theory teaches you to:
- **Distinguish** monitoring (known-unknowns) from observability (unknown-unknowns)
- **Correlate** signals across logs, metrics, and traces
- **Instrument** systems for debuggability, not just alerting
- **Transform** data into actionable insight

This isn't about installing tools. It's about building the mental models that make those tools useful.

## The Mental Shift

| Traditional Monitoring | Modern Observability |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| What's broken? | Why is it broken? |
| Dashboard watching | Hypothesis exploration |
| Known failure modes | Novel failure modes |
| Alert on symptoms | Understand root causes |
| More metrics = better | Right metrics = better |
| Tools-first | Questions-first |

*"Observability is not about logs, metrics, and traces. It's about being able to ask arbitrary questions about your system without having to know in advance what questions you'll need to ask."*
