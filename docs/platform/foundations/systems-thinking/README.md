# Systems Thinking

> **Foundation Track** | 4 Modules | ~2 hours total

Mental models for understanding complex systems. The theoretical foundation for SRE, Platform Engineering, and all operational disciplines.

## Why Systems Thinking?

You can't fix what you don't understand. And you can't understand a distributed system by looking at each component in isolation.

Systems thinking teaches you to see:
- **Wholes, not parts** — Behavior emerges from interactions
- **Patterns, not events** — Look deeper than the current incident
- **Feedback loops** — What drives growth and stability
- **Complexity** — Why systems fail in surprising ways

This foundation applies to everything that follows in the Platform Engineering track.

## Key Concepts You'll Learn

| Concept | Module | What It Means |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Emergence | 1.1 | System behavior that no individual component exhibits |
| Iceberg Model | 1.1 | Events → Patterns → Structures → Mental Models |
| Reinforcing Loop | 1.2 | Feedback that amplifies change (exponential growth/collapse) |
| Balancing Loop | 1.2 | Feedback that opposes change (stability/oscillation) |
| Leverage Points | 1.3 | Places where small changes create big effects |
| Stock-and-Flow | 1.3 | Accumulations and rates of change |
| Cynefin | 1.4 | Framework for categorizing situations (clear, complicated, complex, chaotic) |
| Resilience | 1.4 | Ability to adapt to unexpected failures |
