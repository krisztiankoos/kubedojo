# Platform Engineering Discipline

> Building internal products that make developers productive.

## Overview

Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations. Unlike traditional infrastructure teams that respond to tickets, platform teams build products that enable developers to do their own infrastructure work safely and efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this track, you will be able to:

- Explain what platform engineering is and how it differs from DevOps
- Apply the platform-as-a-product mindset to internal tooling
- Design for developer experience using cognitive load theory
- Architect Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)
- Create effective golden paths that developers actually want to use
- Implement self-service infrastructure with appropriate guardrails
- Assess platform maturity and build improvement roadmaps

## Prerequisites

Before starting this track, you should:

- Understand Kubernetes fundamentals (deployments, services, namespaces)
- Be familiar with CI/CD concepts and tools
- Have experience with infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Pulumi, or similar)
- Complete the **Systems Thinking** foundation track (recommended)

## Key Concepts

### Platform Engineering vs DevOps

| Aspect | DevOps | Platform Engineering |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Focus | Process and culture | Products and tooling |
| Model | Embedded in teams | Separate team serving teams |
| Success metric | Deployment frequency | Developer productivity |
| Interaction | Collaboration | Self-service |

### The Platform-as-a-Product Mindset

Platform teams treat developers as customers:
- Research needs before building
- Measure adoption and satisfaction
- Iterate based on feedback
- Compete with alternatives (shadow IT)

### The Five IDP Pillars

### Cognitive Load Types

| Type | Description | Platform Strategy |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Intrinsic** | Complexity inherent to the task | Can't eliminate, can support |
| **Extraneous** | Unnecessary complexity | **Eliminate through platform** |
| **Germane** | Learning that builds expertise | Preserve and enable |

| Golden handcuffs | Mandates, not paths | Make the right thing easy |
| Ticket queue | Still ticket-based | Build self-service |
| Perfect platform | Never ship | MVP + iterate |

### Maturity Levels

| Level | Name | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Provisional | Ad-hoc, tribal knowledge |
| 2 | Operational | Basic automation, some self-service |
| 3 | Scalable | Self-service works, metrics tracked |
| 4 | Managed | Business impact measured, proactive |
| 5 | Optimizing | Continuous improvement, industry leader |

### Success Metrics

```yaml
Adoption:
  - Golden path usage rate
  - Self-service success rate
  - Time to first deploy

Satisfaction:
  - Developer NPS
  - Support ticket volume
  - Cognitive load surveys

Impact:
  - Deployment frequency
