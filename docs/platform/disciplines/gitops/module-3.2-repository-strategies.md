# Module 3.2: Repository Strategies

> **Discipline Module** | Complexity: `[MEDIUM]` | Time: 30-35 min

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module:
- **Required**: [Module 3.1: What is GitOps?](module-3.1-what-is-gitops.md) — GitOps fundamentals
- **Required**: Git branching and PR workflow experience
- **Recommended**: Experience managing multiple services/environments

---

## Why This Module Matters

You've decided to adopt GitOps. Great! Now where do you put things?

This seemingly simple question determines:
- **Who can change what**: Access control
- **How fast you can deploy**: Sync times, blast radius
- **How teams collaborate**: Coupling vs autonomy
- **How you recover from disasters**: What to restore from where

Bad repository structure creates friction. Good structure enables flow.

This module helps you choose the right structure for your organization.

---

## The Core Decision: Monorepo vs Polyrepo

### Monorepo

All configuration in a single repository.

```
gitops-config/
├── apps/
│   ├── frontend/
│   │   ├── base/
│   │   └── overlays/
│   │       ├── dev/
│   │       ├── staging/
│   │       └── prod/
│   ├── backend/
│   │   ├── base/
│   │   └── overlays/
│   └── database/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── cert-manager/
│   ├── ingress-nginx/
│   └── monitoring/
└── clusters/
    ├── dev/
    ├── staging/
    └── prod/
```

**Pros:**
- Single place to see everything
- Easier cross-cutting changes
- Simplified tooling
- Single set of access controls

**Cons:**
- Can become large and slow
- Tight coupling between teams
- Harder to scale permissions
- One repo's issues affect everyone

**Best for:**
- Smaller organizations (< 50 engineers)
- Platform teams managing infrastructure
- Strong central control needed

### Polyrepo

Configuration spread across multiple repositories.

```
# Repository: team-a-config
team-a-config/
├── service-1/
│   └── overlays/
└── service-2/
    └── overlays/

# Repository: team-b-config
team-b-config/
├── api-gateway/
└── auth-service/

# Repository: platform-config
platform-config/
├── infrastructure/
├── policies/
└── cluster-addons/
```

**Pros:**
- Team autonomy
- Fine-grained access control
- Independent scaling
- Smaller, focused repos

**Cons:**
- Harder to see full picture
- Cross-cutting changes need multiple PRs
- More tooling complexity
- Potential for drift between repos

**Best for:**
- Larger organizations
- Strong team boundaries
- High autonomy cultures

### Hybrid Approach

Most organizations land somewhere in between:

```
# Platform repo (central team)
platform-config/
├── infrastructure/
├── policies/
└── base-configs/

# Team repos (each team owns)
team-a-apps/
├── service-1/
└── service-2/

team-b-apps/
├── api/
└── worker/
```

**Platform repo**: Shared infrastructure, policies, base configurations
**Team repos**: Team-specific applications and customizations

---

## App Repo vs Config Repo

Another key decision: where does configuration live relative to application code?

### Single Repo (App + Config Together)

```
my-service/
├── src/
│   └── main.go
├── Dockerfile
├── Makefile
└── deploy/
    ├── base/
    │   ├── deployment.yaml
    │   ├── service.yaml
    │   └── kustomization.yaml
    └── overlays/
        ├── dev/
        ├── staging/
        └── prod/
```

**Pros:**
- Everything in one place
- App and config versioned together
- Simpler for small teams
- Natural code review includes deploy changes

**Cons:**
- App changes trigger config pipeline
- Config changes trigger app pipeline
- Different audiences (dev vs ops)
- CI/CD complexity

### Separate Repos

```
# Repository: my-service (app code)
my-service/
├── src/
├── Dockerfile
└── Makefile

# Repository: my-service-config (GitOps config)
my-service-config/
├── base/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   └── service.yaml
└── overlays/
    ├── dev/
    ├── staging/
    └── prod/
```

**Pros:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Different permissions (devs vs ops)
- Config changes don't rebuild app
- Clear GitOps boundary

**Cons:**
- Two repos to manage
- Coordination needed
- More complex CI/CD

### The Common Pattern

Most teams settle on:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      Application Repo                        │
│                                                              │
│  Source code + Dockerfile + CI pipeline                      │
│  CI builds image, pushes to registry                         │
│  CI updates image tag in Config Repo                         │
└───────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                    Updates image tag
                            │
                            ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                       Config Repo                            │
│                                                              │
│  Kubernetes manifests, Kustomize overlays                   │
│  GitOps agent watches this repo                              │
│  Agent syncs to cluster                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Try This: Map Your Current Structure

Draw your current repository structure:

```
Current structure:
├── Where is app code? _________________
├── Where are Kubernetes manifests? _________________
├── Where is infrastructure config? _________________
├── How many repos total? _________________

Questions:
1. Can a team deploy without touching other teams' repos? Y/N
2. Can you see all deployed services in one place? Y/N
3. Do app changes require config changes in separate commits? Y/N
4. Are permissions appropriately scoped? Y/N
```

---

## Directory Structures

How you organize files within repos matters as much as which repos you use.

### Environment-Based Structure

```
my-service/
├── base/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── configmap.yaml
│   └── kustomization.yaml
└── overlays/
    ├── dev/
    │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   ├── replica-patch.yaml
    │   └── config-patch.yaml
    ├── staging/
    │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   └── replica-patch.yaml
    └── prod/
        ├── kustomization.yaml
        ├── replica-patch.yaml
        ├── hpa.yaml
        └── pdb.yaml
```

**How Kustomize works:**

```yaml
# base/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
  - configmap.yaml

# overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - ../../base
patches:
  - replica-patch.yaml
  - hpa.yaml
  - pdb.yaml
```

### Cluster-Based Structure

When managing multiple clusters:

```
clusters/
├── dev-cluster/
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   ├── apps/
│   │   ├── frontend/
│   │   └── backend/
│   └── infrastructure/
│       ├── cert-manager/
│       └── ingress/
├── staging-cluster/
│   └── ...
└── prod-cluster/
    ├── us-east/
    │   └── ...
    └── eu-west/
        └── ...
```

### Application-Centric Structure

Organized by application, then environment:

```
apps/
├── frontend/
│   ├── base/
│   └── overlays/
│       ├── dev/
│       ├── staging/
│       └── prod/
├── backend/
│   ├── base/
│   └── overlays/
├── worker/
│   └── ...
└── infrastructure/
    ├── monitoring/
    ├── logging/
    └── ingress/
```

### Choosing a Structure

| Factor | Environment-Based | Cluster-Based | App-Centric |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| "What's in prod?" | Check each app's prod/ | Check prod-cluster/ | Check each app's prod/ |
| "What apps in this cluster?" | Check multiple places | One place | Check multiple places |
| "All configs for this app?" | One place | Multiple clusters | One place |
| Best for | Single cluster per env | Multi-region/cluster | App-focused teams |

## Did You Know?

1. **Google's entire codebase lives in one repository** with billions of files. They built custom tooling (Piper) to make this work. Most organizations can't replicate this.

2. **The "trunk-based development" pattern** pairs well with directory-per-environment GitOps. Short-lived branches for changes, merge to main, promote through directories.

3. **Spotify pioneered many polyrepo patterns** for autonomy, but found they needed strong conventions and tooling to avoid chaos. Their "Golden Path" concept addresses this.

---

## War Story: The Branch Strategy That Backfired

A company I worked with tried branch-per-environment GitOps:

**The Setup:**
```
main branch → production
staging branch → staging
develop branch → development
```

**The Theory:**
- Merge develop → staging to promote
- Merge staging → main to go to prod
- Each environment has "its own branch"

**What Actually Happened:**

Week 1: "This is clean!"

Week 4:
```
develop: 127 commits ahead of staging
staging: 43 commits ahead of main
```

Week 8:
- Merging staging → main caused massive conflicts
- Some features accidentally skipped staging
- "Which branch has the fix?" became common
- Cherry-picks created divergence
- Team spent hours resolving merge conflicts

**The Root Problem:**

Branches diverge. That's what branches do. Environment promotion isn't the same as code development.

**The Fix:**

Switched to directory-per-environment:

```
config-repo/
└── my-service/
    ├── base/
    └── overlays/
        ├── dev/      ← always in main
        ├── staging/  ← always in main
        └── prod/     ← always in main
```

Promotion became:
```bash
# Copy dev image tag to staging
yq eval '.images[0].newTag = "v1.2.3"' -i overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml

# PR, review, merge
# GitOps agent syncs staging
```

**Results:**
- No merge conflicts
- Clear promotion path
- All envs visible in one branch
- PR shows exactly what changes

**Lesson**: Branches are for code development, not environment promotion.

---

## Branch Strategies (And Why to Avoid Them)

### The Temptation

Branches feel natural for environments:
- "main is prod"
- "develop is dev"
- "we control promotion with merges"

### The Problems

**Problem 1: Divergence**
```
Branches naturally diverge. Environments shouldn't.

develop: adds feature A, B, C
staging: only has A, B (C not promoted)
main: only has A (B pending)

Now you have three different states to reason about.
```

**Problem 2: Merge Conflicts**
```
Config conflicts are worse than code conflicts.
Code: "which version of this function?"
Config: "which version of the cluster state?"

Bad merges → bad deployments.
```

**Problem 3: Lost Changes**
```
Feature in develop, cherry-picked to main,
but staging branch never got it.

"Why is this bug in staging but not prod?"
```

**Problem 4: Audit Complexity**
```
Q: "What changed between staging and prod?"
A: "Let me diff two branches that have
    diverged significantly..."

vs. Directory-based:
A: "Let me diff two directories on main."
```

### When Branches Might Work

- Very simple setups (2 environments max)
- Full lockstep promotion (always all changes)
- Strong discipline and tooling
- Small teams with clear ownership

### The Recommendation

**Use directories, not branches, for environment separation.**

```
# Instead of:
git checkout staging
git merge develop

# Do:
# Update prod/kustomization.yaml with new image tag
git commit -m "Promote v1.2.3 to prod"
git push origin main
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Branch-per-environment | Divergence, merge hell | Directory-per-environment |
| Giant monorepo without tooling | Slow, coupled | Split or invest in tooling |
| Too many small repos | Fragmentation, no visibility | Consolidate by team/domain |
| Mixing app code and config | Wrong triggers, permissions | Separate config repo |
| No clear ownership | Confusion, drift | Document who owns what |
| Inconsistent structure | Hard to automate | Standardize patterns |

## Quiz: Check Your Understanding

### Question 1
Why is branch-per-environment problematic for GitOps?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Several reasons:

1. **Branches diverge**: Unlike code, environment configs shouldn't diverge from each other except for intentional differences (replicas, resources)

2. **Merge conflicts**: Config merge conflicts can cause deployment failures

3. **Lost changes**: Cherry-picks and selective merges can miss changes

4. **Audit difficulty**: Comparing branches that have diverged is harder than comparing directories

5. **Cognitive load**: "Which branch is truth for which env?"

**Better approach**: Directory-per-environment on a single branch (main). Promotion = update the directory, PR, merge.

</details>

### Question 2
When would you choose polyrepo over monorepo?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Choose polyrepo when:

1. **Large organization**: Many teams, need independence
2. **Strong team boundaries**: Teams shouldn't see/change each other's configs
3. **Different access needs**: Varying permission requirements
4. **Scale concerns**: Single repo would be too large
5. **Autonomy culture**: Teams want full ownership

Choose monorepo when:

1. **Small organization**: < 50 engineers typically
2. **Central platform team**: Manages most config
3. **Cross-cutting changes**: Frequent changes affecting multiple services
4. **Visibility**: Need to see everything in one place

Most organizations use **hybrid**: platform monorepo + team polyrepos.

</details>

### Question 3
You have 10 microservices and 3 environments (dev, staging, prod). How would you structure the config repo(s)?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Several valid approaches:

**Option A: Single repo, app-centric**
```
config/
├── services/
│   ├── service-1/
│   │   ├── base/
│   │   └── overlays/{dev,staging,prod}
│   ├── service-2/
│   │   ├── base/
│   │   └── overlays/{dev,staging,prod}
│   └── ... (10 services)
└── infrastructure/
    └── overlays/{dev,staging,prod}
```

**Option B: Single repo, env-centric**
```
config/
├── dev/
│   ├── services/
│   └── infrastructure/
├── staging/
│   └── ...
└── prod/
    └── ...
```

**Option C: Team repos (if teams own different services)**
```
team-a-config/ (services 1-4)
team-b-config/ (services 5-7)
team-c-config/ (services 8-10)
platform-config/ (infrastructure)
```

**Recommendation**: Option A is most common for 10 services.
- Base reduces duplication
- Overlays capture env differences
- One place per service

</details>

### Question 4
How does CI interact with GitOps config repos?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Typical flow:

```
1. Developer pushes code to app repo
2. CI builds and tests
3. CI builds container image
4. CI pushes image to registry (e.g., myapp:v1.2.3)
5. CI updates config repo:
   - Clone config repo
   - Update image tag in dev overlay
   - Commit and push (or create PR)
6. GitOps agent detects config repo change
7. Agent syncs new image to cluster
```

**Key points:**
- CI doesn't deploy directly to cluster
- CI only updates Git (image tags)
- GitOps agent does actual deployment
- Image tag is the link between CI and GitOps

**Example CI step (GitHub Actions):**
```yaml
- name: Update config repo
  run: |
    git clone https://github.com/org/config-repo
    cd config-repo
    yq eval '.images[0].newTag = "${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}"' \
      -i services/myapp/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml
    git commit -am "Update myapp to ${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}"
    git push
```

</details>

## Hands-On Exercise: Design Your Repository Structure

Design a GitOps repository structure for a scenario.

### Scenario

Your organization has:
- 3 teams (Platform, Frontend, Backend)
- 8 services total:
  - Platform: cert-manager, ingress-nginx, monitoring
  - Frontend: web-app, mobile-api
  - Backend: user-service, order-service, notification-service
- 3 environments: dev, staging, prod
- Each team wants autonomy over their services
- Platform team needs to set base policies

### Your Task

**Part 1: Repository Decision**

```markdown
## Repository Strategy

How many repos? [ ] 1 (monorepo) [ ] 4 (team repos) [ ] Other: ___

Rationale:
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

Who owns each repo?
- Repo 1: _______________ Owner: _______________
- Repo 2: _______________ Owner: _______________
- ...
```

**Part 2: Directory Structure**

Design the structure for one of the repos:

```markdown
## Directory Structure for: _______________

repo-name/
├──
├──
├──
└──

Explain your choices:
- Why this structure? _______________
- How do environments differ? _______________
- Where are base configs? _______________
```

**Part 3: Promotion Flow**

How does a change get from dev to prod?

```markdown
## Promotion Flow

1. Developer makes change: _______________
2. Change gets to dev: _______________
3. Promote to staging: _______________
4. Promote to prod: _______________

Automation opportunities:
- _______________
- _______________
```

**Part 4: Access Control**

```markdown
## Access Control

| Repo | Read Access | Write Access | Admin |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------|
|      |             |              |       |
|      |             |              |       |

Branch protection rules:
- main: _______________
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Chose monorepo/polyrepo with clear rationale
- [ ] Designed directory structure for at least one repo
- [ ] Defined environment promotion flow
- [ ] Documented access control approach
- [ ] Avoided branch-per-environment

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Monorepo vs Polyrepo**: Choose based on org size, team autonomy, access needs
2. **Separate app and config repos**: Different cadences, different permissions
3. **Directory-per-environment**: Avoid branch-per-environment pattern
4. **Use Kustomize base/overlays**: Reduce duplication, capture differences
5. **CI updates Git, GitOps deploys**: Clean separation of concerns

## Summary

Repository strategy determines how smoothly GitOps operates.

Key decisions:
- **Monorepo vs Polyrepo**: Based on org size and autonomy needs
- **App repo vs Config repo**: Typically separate for GitOps
- **Directory structure**: Environment-based with base/overlays
- **Branch strategy**: Avoid branch-per-env; use directory-per-env

There's no universally "right" answer — but there are patterns that work better for different situations. Start simple, evolve as needed.
