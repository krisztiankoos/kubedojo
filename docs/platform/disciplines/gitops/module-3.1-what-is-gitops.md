# Module 3.1: What is GitOps?

> **Discipline Module** | Complexity: `[MEDIUM]` | Time: 30-35 min

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module:
- **Required**: [Systems Thinking Track](../../foundations/systems-thinking/) — Understanding feedback loops
- **Required**: Basic Git knowledge (branches, commits, pull requests)
- **Recommended**: [Kubernetes Basics](../../../prerequisites/kubernetes-basics/) — Pod, Deployment, Service concepts
- **Helpful**: Experience with CI/CD pipelines

---

## Why This Module Matters

You've built a great CI/CD pipeline. Code gets tested, images get built, deployments happen automatically.

Then someone runs `kubectl apply` directly in production. Your Git repo and production are now out of sync. Which one is "right"?

**This is the problem GitOps solves.**

GitOps makes Git the single source of truth for your infrastructure. Not your CI/CD tool. Not someone's terminal. Git.

After this module, you'll understand:
- Why GitOps emerged and what problems it solves
- The four core principles of GitOps
- How GitOps differs from traditional CI/CD
- When GitOps is (and isn't) the right approach

---

## The Origin Story

### 2017: Weaveworks' Challenge

Weaveworks was running Kubernetes clusters at scale. They had a problem:

**Traditional deployment workflow:**
```
Developer → CI/CD Pipeline → kubectl apply → Cluster
```

This worked, but:
- CI/CD systems had production credentials
- Hard to know what's actually deployed
- Manual changes bypassed the pipeline
- No easy way to recover from disasters

**Their insight**: What if the cluster continuously pulled its desired state from Git, instead of being pushed to?

They called this approach **GitOps**.

> "GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications."
> — Weaveworks, 2017

### 2021: OpenGitOps

GitOps grew beyond Weaveworks. The CNCF formed the OpenGitOps working group to standardize the principles.

The result: Four core principles that define what GitOps is (and isn't).

---

## The Four GitOps Principles

From OpenGitOps.dev:

### Principle 1: Declarative

> "A system managed by GitOps must have its desired state expressed declaratively."

**What this means:**
- Describe *what* you want, not *how* to get there
- YAML manifests, not shell scripts
- The end state, not the steps

```yaml
# Declarative (GitOps)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: my-app:v1.2.3
```

```bash
# Imperative (NOT GitOps)
kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=3
kubectl set image deployment/my-app app=my-app:v1.2.3
```

### Principle 2: Versioned and Immutable

> "Desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability, versioning and retains a complete version history."

**What this means:**
- Git as the storage system
- Every change is a commit
- Full audit trail
- Easy rollback (git revert)

```
commit abc123: Update replicas to 5
commit def456: Update image to v1.2.4
commit ghi789: Add resource limits
commit jkl012: Rollback to v1.2.3  ← Easy!
```

### Principle 3: Pulled Automatically

> "Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from the source."

**What this means:**
- Agents in the cluster pull from Git
- No push access needed to cluster
- Continuous reconciliation
- Cluster pulls what it needs

```
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│    Git      │ ◀────── │   Agent     │
│  (Source)   │  pulls  │ (in cluster)│
└─────────────┘         └─────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
                        ┌─────────────┐
                        │  Cluster    │
                        │  Resources  │
                        └─────────────┘
```

### Principle 4: Continuously Reconciled

> "Software agents continuously observe actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state."

**What this means:**
- Agents compare desired vs actual state
- Differences trigger reconciliation
- Self-healing: drift is automatically corrected
- Constant loop, not one-time action

```
         ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
         │                                  │
         ▼                                  │
   ┌──────────┐    Compare    ┌──────────┐  │
   │ Desired  │ ────────────▶ │  Actual  │  │
   │  State   │               │  State   │  │
   │  (Git)   │               │(Cluster) │  │
   └──────────┘               └──────────┘  │
                                   │        │
                         If different       │
                                   │        │
                                   ▼        │
                            ┌──────────┐    │
                            │  Apply   │ ───┘
                            │  Changes │
                            └──────────┘
```

## Try This: GitOps Mental Model

Think about a service you manage. Answer these questions:

```
1. Where is the desired state defined?
   [ ] Git repo (declarative YAML)
   [ ] CI/CD pipeline scripts
   [ ] Someone's local machine
   [ ] It's... complicated

2. If I delete a pod manually, what happens?
   [ ] Agent recreates it from Git (GitOps)
   [ ] Nothing until next deploy
   [ ] Depends on who's watching

3. How do you know what's deployed in production?
   [ ] Check the Git repo
   [ ] Run kubectl commands
   [ ] Ask the last person who deployed
   [ ] Hope for the best
```

GitOps answers should be: Git repo, Agent recreates it, Check Git repo.

## Pull vs Push: The Key Difference

### Traditional CI/CD (Push Model)

```
┌──────┐    ┌────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│ Dev  │───▶│   CI   │───▶│   CD    │───▶│ Cluster │
│      │    │ Build  │    │ Deploy  │    │         │
└──────┘    └────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
                               │
                          Has creds
                          to push
```

**How it works:**
1. Developer pushes code
2. CI builds and tests
3. CD has cluster credentials
4. CD pushes changes to cluster

**Problems:**
- CD system needs cluster credentials
- Credentials outside the cluster = attack surface
- One-time push, no continuous reconciliation
- Drift can occur between pushes

### GitOps (Pull Model)

```
┌──────┐    ┌────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│ Dev  │───▶│   CI   │───▶│   Git   │
│      │    │ Build  │    │  Repo   │
└──────┘    └────────┘    └────┬────┘
                               │
                          Is pulled by
                               │
                               ▼
                         ┌─────────┐
                         │  Agent  │
                         │(in-cluster)│
                         └────┬────┘
                              │
                         Applies to
                              │
                              ▼
                         ┌─────────┐
                         │ Cluster │
                         └─────────┘
```

**How it works:**
1. Developer pushes code
2. CI builds, tests, pushes image, updates Git
3. Agent in cluster pulls from Git
4. Agent applies changes to cluster

**Benefits:**
- No external system has cluster credentials
- Agent only needs read access to Git
- Continuous reconciliation (self-healing)
- Git is always the truth

## Did You Know?

1. **The term "GitOps" was coined by Alexis Richardson** (Weaveworks CEO) in a 2017 blog post. He was trying to describe how Weaveworks operated their own infrastructure.

2. **GitOps isn't Git-specific**. While Git is the most common, the principles work with any version control system that provides immutability and history. Some teams use OCI registries for config storage.

3. **Google's Borg (Kubernetes' predecessor) used a similar pattern** — a central config system with continuous reconciliation — long before GitOps was named.

4. **The OpenGitOps project** became a CNCF Sandbox project in 2021, establishing GitOps as an industry-standard practice with formal principles rather than just a marketing term.

## War Story: The Deployment That Fixed Itself

A company I worked with had just adopted GitOps with ArgoCD.

**The Incident:**

Friday afternoon. A developer was debugging a production issue. In desperation, they ran:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment api-server --replicas=10
```

The extra replicas helped temporarily. Developer went home for the weekend.

**What Happened Next (Old World):**

In the old CI/CD world, those 10 replicas would stay until someone noticed and asked "why do we have 10 replicas?" Probably Monday. Maybe never.

**What Happened Next (GitOps World):**

Within 3 minutes:
1. ArgoCD detected drift: Git said 3 replicas, cluster had 10
2. ArgoCD reconciled: scaled back to 3 replicas
3. Alert fired: "Deployment modified outside GitOps"

The developer got a Slack notification. They realized they needed to:
1. Fix the actual problem (not just scale)
2. If scaling was needed, do it through Git

**The Lesson:**

GitOps didn't prevent the manual change — but it **detected it immediately** and **corrected it automatically**. The cluster state always matched Git.

**Bonus**: The audit trail showed exactly when the manual change happened, who the ArgoCD alert notified, and when it was corrected.

## GitOps vs CI/CD

GitOps and CI/CD aren't opposites — they're complementary.

### What CI Does

- Build code
- Run tests
- Create artifacts (images, packages)
- Scan for vulnerabilities

### What CD Does (Traditional)

- Deploy artifacts to environments
- Manage credentials
- Execute deployment scripts

### What GitOps Does

- Store desired state in Git
- Continuously reconcile cluster to match Git
- Detect and fix drift
- Provide audit trail

### The Combined Model

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         CI                             │
│  Code → Build → Test → Image → Push to Registry        │
└───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
                    Update image tag in Git
                            │
                            ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                       GitOps                           │
│  Git Repo ← Agent → Reconcile → Cluster                │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

CI builds. GitOps deploys.

## When GitOps Works Best

### Good Fit

| Scenario | Why GitOps Helps |
|----------|------------------|
| Kubernetes workloads | Native YAML, reconciliation-friendly |
| Multiple environments | Same process, different configs |
| Compliance requirements | Built-in audit trail |
| Team collaboration | PRs for infrastructure changes |
| Disaster recovery | Redeploy from Git |
| Multi-cluster | Single source of truth |

### Less Good Fit

| Scenario | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| Stateful systems | State in cluster != state in Git |
| Real-time config | Git commit latency |
| Legacy systems | May not be declarative |
| Secrets (naively) | Can't store plaintext in Git |
| One-off scripts | Imperative by nature |

### The Hybrid Reality

Most organizations use GitOps for:
- Kubernetes manifests
- Infrastructure as Code
- Configuration management

But keep traditional approaches for:
- Secrets management (with integration)
- Stateful operations
- Emergency fixes (then sync to Git)

---

## GitOps Tooling Landscape

Several tools implement GitOps principles:

### Flux

- CNCF graduated project
- Kubernetes-native
- Composable toolkit
- Git + Helm + Kustomize support

### ArgoCD

- CNCF incubating project
- Web UI included
- Application-centric model
- Popular in enterprises

### Others

- **Rancher Fleet**: Multi-cluster focus
- **Jenkins X**: Full CI/CD + GitOps
- **Werf**: Integrated CI/CD
- **Codefresh**: Commercial GitOps platform

We'll explore specific tools in the [GitOps Tools Toolkit](../../toolkits/gitops-tools/).

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Storing secrets in Git | Security breach | Use Sealed Secrets, External Secrets, or SOPS |
| Push model labeled "GitOps" | Missing reconciliation benefits | True GitOps is pull-based with continuous reconciliation |
| Manual kubectl "just this once" | Drift, confusion | All changes through Git, enforce with policies |
| No drift detection alerts | Don't know when drift occurs | Configure alerts for reconciliation failures |
| Giant monorepo | Slow sync, coupling | Consider repo structure carefully |
| Branch-per-environment | Merge conflicts, confusion | Directory-per-environment preferred |

## Quiz: Check Your Understanding

### Question 1
What makes GitOps different from traditional CI/CD deployment?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Key differences:

1. **Pull vs Push**: GitOps agents pull from Git; traditional CD pushes to cluster
2. **Continuous reconciliation**: GitOps constantly syncs, not just at deploy time
3. **Self-healing**: Drift is automatically corrected
4. **Credentials location**: Agent in cluster vs CD system outside cluster

Traditional CI/CD can be part of GitOps (for building), but deployment works differently.

</details>

### Question 2
Someone manually runs `kubectl delete pod my-app-xyz` in a GitOps-managed cluster. What should happen?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

1. **Kubernetes recreates the pod** (from the Deployment controller)
2. **GitOps agent detects this is consistent** with desired state (still 3 replicas)
3. **No action needed** — the Deployment still matches Git

However, if someone ran `kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=10`:
1. Kubernetes would scale to 10
2. GitOps agent would detect drift (Git says 3, cluster has 10)
3. Agent would scale back to 3
4. Alert would fire (drift detected)

GitOps manages the Deployment spec, not individual pods.

</details>

### Question 3
Why is "Git as source of truth" valuable for disaster recovery?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

If you lose a cluster entirely:

1. **Spin up new cluster**
2. **Install GitOps agent**
3. **Point agent at Git repo**
4. **Agent recreates everything**

No need to:
- Remember what was deployed
- Find old CI/CD logs
- Hope someone documented it
- Restore from cluster backups

The entire desired state is in Git. The agent rebuilds the cluster to match.

This also works for:
- Cluster migrations
- Multi-region deployments
- Compliance audits (prove what's deployed)

</details>

### Question 4
Which GitOps principle addresses security concerns about deployment credentials?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Principle 3: Pulled Automatically**

"Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from the source."

This means:
- The agent lives **inside** the cluster
- The agent only needs **read access** to Git
- No external system has **write access** to the cluster
- Cluster credentials stay inside the cluster

Compare to traditional CD:
- CD system **outside** cluster
- CD needs **write credentials** to cluster
- Credentials stored in CI/CD platform
- Larger attack surface

## Key Takeaways

1. **GitOps = Git as source of truth** — all changes through Git, continuously reconciled
2. **Four principles**: Declarative, Versioned, Pulled, Continuously Reconciled
3. **Pull > Push**: Agent in cluster pulls from Git, no external credentials needed
4. **Self-healing**: Drift is detected and corrected automatically
5. **CI builds, GitOps deploys**: They're complementary, not competing

---

## Summary

GitOps is an operational model where:
- Git is the single source of truth
- Desired state is declarative and versioned
- Agents pull and apply changes continuously
- Drift is detected and corrected automatically

It's not just "using Git for config" — it's a fundamentally different deployment model that provides:
- Better security (no external cluster credentials)
- Better reliability (self-healing)
- Better auditability (full Git history)
- Better disaster recovery (rebuild from Git)

GitOps transforms how you think about deployments: from "push changes to production" to "declare what production should be."
