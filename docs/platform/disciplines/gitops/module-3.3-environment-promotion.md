# Module 3.3: Environment Promotion

> **Discipline Module** | Complexity: `[MEDIUM]` | Time: 30-35 min

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module:
- **Required**: [Module 3.2: Repository Strategies](module-3.2-repository-strategies.md) — Repository structure
- **Required**: [Module 3.1: What is GitOps?](module-3.1-what-is-gitops.md) — GitOps fundamentals
- **Recommended**: Experience with multi-environment deployments

---

## Why This Module Matters

Your new feature works in dev. Now what?

The journey from dev to production is where most deployment problems occur:
- "It worked in staging!" (but prod is different)
- "Who promoted this?" (no audit trail)
- "Can we roll back?" (unclear what to roll back to)

**Good promotion strategy means:**
- Changes are tested before reaching users
- Promotions are auditable and reversible
- The path to production is clear and consistent

This module teaches you how to promote changes safely through environments using GitOps.

---

## The Promotion Problem

In traditional deployments, promotion often means:
1. Run CI/CD pipeline for staging
2. Wait for manual approval
3. Run CI/CD pipeline for prod
4. Hope nothing is different

**What can go wrong:**
- Different pipeline runs = potentially different results
- Config drift between environments
- Manual steps introduce errors
- No clear record of what was promoted

GitOps changes this by making promotion a **Git operation**.

---

## Directory-Based Promotion

The simplest and most common GitOps promotion pattern.

### The Structure

```
my-service/
├── base/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   └── kustomization.yaml
└── overlays/
    ├── dev/
    │   └── kustomization.yaml     # image: v1.2.3
    ├── staging/
    │   └── kustomization.yaml     # image: v1.2.2
    └── prod/
        └── kustomization.yaml     # image: v1.2.1
```

### Promotion = Update Image Tag

```yaml
# overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - ../../base
images:
  - name: my-service
    newTag: v1.2.3  # Latest in dev

# overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - ../../base
images:
  - name: my-service
    newTag: v1.2.2  # Promoted from dev

# overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - ../../base
images:
  - name: my-service
    newTag: v1.2.1  # Promoted from staging
```

### The Promotion Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        Git Repository                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         │                    │                    │
         ▼                    ▼                    ▼
   overlays/dev/        overlays/staging/    overlays/prod/
   image: v1.2.3        image: v1.2.2        image: v1.2.1
         │                    │                    │
         │                    │                    │
    Promote:             Promote:             Deployed:
    PR to update         PR to update         GitOps syncs
    staging/tag          prod/tag
```

### Manual Promotion

```bash
# Promote v1.2.3 from dev to staging
cd config-repo

# Update staging overlay
yq eval '.images[0].newTag = "v1.2.3"' -i overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml

# Commit and push
git add overlays/staging/
git commit -m "Promote my-service v1.2.3 to staging"
git push origin main

# GitOps agent syncs staging cluster
```

### Automated Promotion

```yaml
# GitHub Action for auto-promotion
name: Promote to Staging

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Version to promote'
        required: true

jobs:
  promote:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Update staging image tag
        run: |
          yq eval '.images[0].newTag = "${{ inputs.version }}"' \
            -i overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml

      - name: Create PR
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
        with:
          title: "Promote my-service ${{ inputs.version }} to staging"
          branch: promote-staging-${{ inputs.version }}
          body: |
            Promoting my-service to staging.

            **Version**: ${{ inputs.version }}
            **Source**: dev environment

            Please review and merge to complete promotion.
```

---

## Try This: Trace a Promotion

Think about a recent deployment to production:

```
1. What version/commit was promoted? _________________
2. When did it reach each environment?
   - Dev: _________________
   - Staging: _________________
   - Prod: _________________
3. Who approved each promotion? _________________
4. What testing happened between environments? _________________
5. How would you roll back? _________________
```

If you can't answer these easily, your promotion process needs work.

---

## Image Tag Promotion

The most common artifact to promote is the container image tag.

### Why Image Tags?

```
Image tag represents:
- Specific code version
- Built artifact
- Immutable (if using proper tagging)

Promoting an image tag = deploying exact same artifact
```

### Tag Strategies

**Semantic Versioning:**
```
my-service:v1.2.3
my-service:v1.2.4
my-service:v2.0.0
```
- Clear version progression
- Works well with release processes
- Requires version management

**Git SHA:**
```
my-service:abc123f
my-service:def456g
```
- Directly traceable to code
- No version management needed
- Less human-readable

**Git SHA + Build Number:**
```
my-service:abc123f-42
my-service:def456g-43
```
- Traceable + ordering
- Useful for debugging

**Avoid:**
```
my-service:latest    # Mutable, ambiguous
my-service:staging   # Which version?
```

### Promotion Script Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# promote.sh - Promote image tag through environments

set -e

VERSION=$1
FROM_ENV=$2
TO_ENV=$3

if [ -z "$VERSION" ] || [ -z "$FROM_ENV" ] || [ -z "$TO_ENV" ]; then
  echo "Usage: ./promote.sh <version> <from-env> <to-env>"
  echo "Example: ./promote.sh v1.2.3 dev staging"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Promoting $VERSION from $FROM_ENV to $TO_ENV"

# Verify version exists in source environment
CURRENT=$(yq eval '.images[0].newTag' overlays/$FROM_ENV/kustomization.yaml)
if [ "$CURRENT" != "$VERSION" ]; then
  echo "Warning: $FROM_ENV has $CURRENT, not $VERSION"
  read -p "Continue anyway? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
  echo
  if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    exit 1
  fi
fi

# Update target environment
yq eval ".images[0].newTag = \"$VERSION\"" -i overlays/$TO_ENV/kustomization.yaml

# Show diff
git diff overlays/$TO_ENV/

# Commit
git add overlays/$TO_ENV/
git commit -m "Promote my-service $VERSION to $TO_ENV

Promoted from: $FROM_ENV
Previous version: $(git show HEAD^:overlays/$TO_ENV/kustomization.yaml | yq '.images[0].newTag')"

echo "Committed. Push to deploy."
```

## Progressive Delivery

Beyond simple environment promotion, progressive delivery gradually shifts traffic.

### Canary Deployments

```
100% traffic │████████████████████████│ v1.2.2 (stable)
             │                        │
  5% traffic │█                       │ v1.2.3 (canary)
             │                        │
             └────────────────────────┘

Monitor canary for errors...

If OK:   Increase to 25%, 50%, 100%
If bad:  Roll back canary
```

**GitOps Canary with Flagger:**

```yaml
apiVersion: flagger.app/v1beta1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-service
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 60
  service:
    port: 80
  analysis:
    interval: 30s
    threshold: 5
    maxWeight: 50
    stepWeight: 10
    metrics:
      - name: request-success-rate
        thresholdRange:
          min: 99
        interval: 1m
      - name: request-duration
        thresholdRange:
          max: 500
        interval: 30s
```

### Blue-Green Deployments

```
Blue (current)  │████████████████████████│ v1.2.2 (100%)
                │                        │
Green (new)     │████████████████████████│ v1.2.3 (0%)
                │                        │
                └────────────────────────┘

Test Green environment...

If OK:   Switch traffic: Blue=0%, Green=100%
If bad:  Keep traffic on Blue
```

**GitOps Blue-Green with Argo Rollouts:**

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  replicas: 5
  strategy:
    blueGreen:
      activeService: my-service
      previewService: my-service-preview
      autoPromotionEnabled: false  # Manual promotion
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-service
          image: my-service:v1.2.3
```

### When to Use Progressive Delivery

| Scenario | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| Low risk, fast feedback | Direct promotion |
| Medium risk, need validation | Canary (gradual) |
| High risk, need full testing | Blue-green (parallel) |
| Critical services | Canary with automated rollback |

## Did You Know?

1. **Facebook deploys code to 2% of users first**, then gradually rolls out. They call this "gatekeeper" and have done it for over a decade.

2. **"GitOps promotion" is fundamentally different from "CI/CD promotion"**. In CI/CD, the pipeline pushes. In GitOps, the change is a Git commit and the cluster pulls.

3. **Some teams use "promotion bots"** that automatically promote after tests pass and a timer expires. No human approval needed for staging, human approval only for prod.

## War Story: The Promotion That Skipped Staging

A team I worked with had an "emergency fix":

**The Situation:**
- Bug in production causing customer issues
- Developer had a fix ready
- "We don't have time for staging!"

**What They Did:**
```bash
# Direct to prod (bad idea!)
git checkout main
yq eval '.images[0].newTag = "hotfix-123"' -i overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml
git commit -m "Emergency fix for customer issue"
git push
```

**What Happened:**

The fix worked for the original bug. But the hotfix image:
- Had a different config dependency
- Config existed in dev (where it was developed)
- Config didn't exist in prod
- New bug: service crashed on startup

**Impact:**
- 15 minutes of downtime
- Customer issue now worse
- Emergency rollback
- 3 AM debugging session

**The Root Cause:**

The fix wasn't tested in an environment that matched prod. Skipping staging meant skipping validation.

**The Better Approach:**

```bash
# Even for emergencies:
1. Deploy to staging first (10 min)
2. Quick smoke test (5 min)
3. Deploy to prod
4. Total: 15 min delayed, hours of debugging saved
```

**Policy Change:**

They implemented:
1. No direct-to-prod promotions, ever
2. "Emergency" staging = fast track, not skip
3. Automated smoke tests in staging
4. Alert if prod has version not in staging

**Lesson:** Emergencies don't justify skipping environments. They justify faster promotion through environments.

---

## Approval Workflows

Promotion often requires human approval, especially for production.

### Pull Request Approvals

```yaml
# GitHub branch protection for config repo
# main branch rules:
- Require pull request before merging
- Require 1 approval for overlays/staging/
- Require 2 approvals for overlays/prod/
- Require status checks to pass
```

### GitOps Tool Integration

**ArgoCD Sync Windows:**
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  name: production
spec:
  syncWindows:
    - kind: allow
      schedule: '0 10-16 * * 1-5'  # Weekdays 10am-4pm
      duration: 6h
      applications:
        - '*'
    - kind: deny
      schedule: '0 0 * * 0'  # No Sunday deploys
      duration: 24h
```

**Flux Notifications:**
```yaml
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Alert
metadata:
  name: production-promotions
spec:
  providerRef:
    name: slack
  eventSeverity: info
  eventSources:
    - kind: Kustomization
      name: '*'
      namespace: flux-system
  inclusionList:
    - ".*overlays/prod.*"
```

### Approval Patterns

| Pattern | How It Works | Best For |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| PR approval | Human approves PR | Most teams |
| Scheduled windows | Auto-approve during windows | Controlled deployments |
| Test gates | Auto-approve if tests pass | High automation |
| Change advisory | External approval system | Enterprise/compliance |

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Skipping environments | Bugs reach prod untested | Always promote through all envs |
| Manual copy-paste | Errors, inconsistency | Use scripts/automation |
| No approval for prod | Risky changes slip through | Require PR approval |
| Same image tag, different configs | Works in staging, fails in prod | Include config in testing |
| No rollback plan | Stuck with broken deploy | Always know how to roll back |
| Promote on Friday | Weekend incidents | Freeze before weekends |

## Quiz: Check Your Understanding

### Question 1
Why is promoting image tags better than promoting "latest"?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Image tags provide:**

1. **Immutability**: `v1.2.3` is always the same image
2. **Traceability**: Know exactly what's deployed
3. **Reproducibility**: Can deploy same version anywhere
4. **Rollback clarity**: Roll back to `v1.2.2`, not "previous latest"

**"latest" problems:**

1. **Mutable**: Changes over time
2. **Ambiguous**: "latest" when? Built by whom?
3. **Not reproducible**: Can't redeploy same "latest" later
4. **Rollback unclear**: What was previous "latest"?

**Rule**: Never use `latest` in production. Use immutable tags (semver or git SHA).

</details>

### Question 2
Your prod deployment failed. How do you roll back with GitOps?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Option 1: Git revert (recommended)**
```bash
# Find the promotion commit
git log --oneline overlays/prod/

# Revert it
git revert <commit-sha>
git push origin main

# GitOps agent syncs reverted state
```

**Option 2: Update to previous version**
```bash
# Set image back to previous version
yq eval '.images[0].newTag = "v1.2.2"' -i overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml
git commit -m "Rollback: v1.2.3 -> v1.2.2 due to <reason>"
git push origin main
```

**Option 3: GitOps tool rollback**
```bash
# ArgoCD
argocd app rollback my-app

# Flux
flux suspend kustomization prod
# Fix in Git, then:
flux resume kustomization prod
```

**Best practice**: Use git revert to maintain history. The rollback itself is audited.

</details>

### Question 3
How do you ensure staging is always tested before prod?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Technical controls:**

1. **PR rules**: Prod changes require staging version match
   ```yaml
   # CI check: verify staging has the version being promoted to prod
   ```

2. **Required checks**: Tests must pass in staging before prod merge

3. **Sync windows**: Prod only deploys after staging stabilization period

4. **Alerts**: Notify if prod has version not in staging

**Process controls:**

1. **Policy**: All promotions follow dev → staging → prod
2. **Review**: Prod PRs require evidence of staging success
3. **Automation**: Promotion scripts enforce the path

**Example CI check:**
```bash
STAGING_VERSION=$(yq '.images[0].newTag' overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml)
PROD_VERSION=$(yq '.images[0].newTag' overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml)
NEW_PROD_VERSION=$(git diff HEAD^ -- overlays/prod/ | grep newTag | ...)

if [ "$NEW_PROD_VERSION" != "$STAGING_VERSION" ]; then
  echo "Error: Promoting $NEW_PROD_VERSION to prod but staging has $STAGING_VERSION"
  exit 1
fi
```

</details>

### Question 4
When would you use canary vs blue-green deployment?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Canary (gradual rollout):**
- Slowly increase traffic to new version
- Good for: catching issues with real traffic patterns
- Rollback: shift traffic back to stable
- Use when: you want production traffic validation

**Blue-green (parallel environments):**
- Run both versions simultaneously
- Test new version completely before switching
- Rollback: instant switch back to blue
- Use when: you need full testing before any production traffic

**Decision factors:**

| Factor | Canary | Blue-Green |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Resource usage | Lower (gradual) | Higher (2x during deploy) |
| Rollback speed | Gradual | Instant |
| Production testing | Yes (partial traffic) | No (separate preview) |
| User impact on failure | Partial users affected | No users affected |
| Complexity | Medium | Medium |

**Common approach**: Blue-green for staging (safe testing), canary for prod (gradual exposure).

## Hands-On Exercise: Design Promotion Pipeline

Design a complete promotion pipeline for a service.

### Scenario

- **Service**: `order-service`
- **Environments**: dev, staging, prod
- **Requirements**:
  - Auto-deploy to dev on merge to main
  - Manual promotion to staging
  - Approval required for prod
  - Ability to roll back any environment

### Part 1: Repository Structure

```markdown
## Repository Structure

config-repo/
├── order-service/
│   ├── base/
│   │   ├── deployment.yaml
│   │   ├── service.yaml
│   │   └── kustomization.yaml
│   └── overlays/
│       ├── dev/
│       │   └── kustomization.yaml
│       ├── staging/
│       │   └── kustomization.yaml
│       └── prod/
│           └── kustomization.yaml
```

### Part 2: Promotion Commands

Define the exact commands/steps:

```markdown
## Promotion Steps

### Dev (automatic)
Trigger: Merge to main in app repo
Steps:
1. CI builds image: order-service:<git-sha>
2. CI updates: _______________
3. GitOps agent syncs

### Staging (manual trigger)
Trigger: Developer initiates promotion
Steps:
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________

### Prod (with approval)
Trigger: Release manager initiates
Steps:
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________
```

### Part 3: Rollback Procedure

```markdown
## Rollback Procedure

### If bad deployment detected:

**Step 1**: Identify the bad version
```bash
# Command to see current deployed version:
_______________
```

**Step 2**: Find previous good version
```bash
# Command to see version history:
_______________
```

**Step 3**: Roll back
```bash
# Commands to roll back:
_______________
_______________
```

**Step 4**: Verify
```bash
# How to verify rollback successful:
_______________
```
```

### Part 4: Approval Configuration

```markdown
## Approval Configuration

### Staging
- Required approvals: ___
- Who can approve: _______________

### Prod
- Required approvals: ___
- Who can approve: _______________
- Deployment windows: _______________
- Blackout periods: _______________
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Defined promotion steps for all three environments
- [ ] Specified how auto-deploy to dev works
- [ ] Created rollback procedure with actual commands
- [ ] Documented approval requirements
- [ ] Included deployment windows/blackouts for prod

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Promotion = Git commit**: Change the image tag in the environment directory
2. **Never skip environments**: Even emergencies go through staging (just faster)
3. **Use immutable image tags**: semver or git SHA, never `latest`
4. **Progressive delivery**: Consider canary/blue-green for production
5. **Approval gates**: PR approvals, sync windows, test gates

## Summary

Environment promotion in GitOps is a Git operation:
- Update the image tag in the environment's directory
- Create a PR (for approval)
- Merge to deploy

This provides:
- Clear audit trail
- Easy rollback (git revert)
- Consistent process
- Approval integration

The key insight: promotion is declaring "this environment should have this version." The GitOps agent makes it so.
