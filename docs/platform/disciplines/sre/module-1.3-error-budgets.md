# Module 1.3: Error Budgets

> **Discipline Module** | Complexity: `[MEDIUM]` | Time: 30-35 min

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module:
- **Required**: [Module 1.2: Service Level Objectives](module-1.2-slos.md) — Understanding SLOs
- **Required**: [Reliability Engineering Track](../../foundations/reliability-engineering/) — Reliability concepts
- **Recommended**: Experience with software releases and deployment

---

## Why This Module Matters

Here's the fundamental tension in every software organization:

- **Development wants**: Ship features fast, experiment, innovate
- **Operations wants**: Stability, predictability, no surprises

These goals seem opposed. The faster you ship, the more risk. The more stable you are, the slower you ship.

**Error budgets resolve this tension.** They turn the reliability vs. velocity debate into a data-driven conversation.

Instead of arguing "should we release?" you calculate "do we have budget to release?"

This module shows you how error budgets work and how to use them to make better decisions.

---

## What Is an Error Budget?

An error budget is the inverse of your SLO — the amount of unreliability you're allowed.

```
Error Budget = 100% - SLO Target

For 99.9% availability SLO:
  Error Budget = 100% - 99.9% = 0.1%
```

That 0.1% is **yours to spend**. You can "spend" it on:
- Feature releases that might have bugs
- Experiments that might fail
- Infrastructure changes that might cause issues
- Maintenance windows
- Or just accept that some failures happen

When you exhaust your budget, you stop releasing until it recovers.

### The Genius of Error Budgets

Error budgets reframe the conversation:

| Without Error Budgets | With Error Budgets |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| "Is this release risky?" | "Do we have budget for this risk?" |
| "Operations says no releases" | "Budget says we can release" |
| "Zero failures is the goal" | "We're supposed to have some failures" |
| Endless debates | Data-driven decisions |

**Key insight**: If you never exhaust your error budget, your SLO is too loose. If you always exhaust it, your SLO is too tight.

---

## Error Budget Math

### Time-Based Calculation

```
Budget in time = SLO Window × (1 - SLO Target)

For 99.9% SLO over 30 days:
  Budget = 30 days × (1 - 0.999)
        = 30 days × 0.001
        = 0.03 days
        = 43.2 minutes

You're allowed 43.2 minutes of downtime per month.
```

### Request-Based Calculation

```
Budget in requests = Total Requests × (1 - SLO Target)

For 99.9% SLO with 10 million requests/month:
  Budget = 10,000,000 × (1 - 0.999)
        = 10,000,000 × 0.001
        = 10,000 failed requests

You're allowed 10,000 failed requests per month.
```

### Budget Consumption

```
Budget Consumed = (Allowed Errors - Actual Errors) / Allowed Errors
               = Actual Errors / Allowed Errors

Example:
  Allowed: 10,000 failed requests
  Actual so far: 4,000 failed requests

  Budget Remaining = (10,000 - 4,000) / 10,000
                  = 60% remaining
```

---

## Try This: Calculate Your Error Budget

For a service you work on:

```
1. What's your SLO? ____%
2. What's your SLO window? ____ days
3. How many requests per window? ____

Time budget = window × (1 - SLO) = ____ minutes
Request budget = requests × (1 - SLO) = ____ requests

Current errors this window: ____
Budget remaining: ____%
```

---

## Error Budget Policies

An error budget is useless without policies that define what happens when it's consumed.

### The Standard Policy

```
If error budget remaining:
  > 50%: Full speed ahead. Ship what you want.
  25-50%: Caution. Extra testing, staged rollouts.
  0-25%: Slow down. Only critical releases.
  < 0%: Stop. Reliability work only.
```

### Example Policy Document

```yaml
error_budget_policy:
  service: payment-api
  slo_target: 99.9%
  window: 30d

  thresholds:
    healthy:
      range: "> 50% budget remaining"
      actions:
        - Normal release cadence
        - Experiments allowed
        - On-call: standard procedures

    caution:
      range: "25-50% budget remaining"
      actions:
        - Staged rollouts required
        - Increased monitoring during releases
        - On-call: heightened awareness

    critical:
      range: "5-25% budget remaining"
      actions:
        - Only critical bug fixes
        - All releases need SRE approval
        - Reliability improvements prioritized

    frozen:
      range: "< 5% budget remaining"
      actions:
        - Feature freeze
        - Only reliability work
        - Incident review for all outages
        - Daily leadership updates

  exceptions:
    - Security fixes: Always allowed
    - Critical bugs: Case-by-case
    - Scheduled maintenance: Pre-approved budget spend
```

### Making the Policy Real

The policy must have consequences, or it won't work:

**Development Impact:**
- Budget healthy → Ship features
- Budget exhausted → Stop features, fix reliability

**On-Call Impact:**
- Budget healthy → Standard response
- Budget low → Heightened awareness, faster escalation

**Leadership Impact:**
- Budget healthy → Business as usual
- Budget exhausted → Daily reports, priority adjustment

## Balancing Reliability and Velocity

Error budgets are a negotiation tool between development and operations.

### The Trade-Off Visualization

```
         RELIABILITY
              ↑
         High │    Slow releases
              │    Happy ops
              │    Frustrated devs
              │
              │
              │                   × Sweet spot
              │
              │
         Low  │    Fast releases
              │    Happy devs
              │    Frustrated ops
              └────────────────────────→
                                   VELOCITY

Error budgets find the sweet spot where:
  - Users are happy enough (meeting SLO)
  - Development moves fast enough (spending budget)
```

### Using Budget to Make Decisions

**Scenario**: Team wants to ship a risky new feature

| Budget Status | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| 70% remaining | Ship it! We have budget for risk |
| 30% remaining | Ship with extra monitoring and quick rollback |
| 10% remaining | Wait or reduce scope |
| Exhausted | No, fix reliability first |

**Scenario**: Major refactoring needed

| Budget Status | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| High budget | Good time for risky changes |
| Low budget | Bad time, defer unless it improves reliability |
| Exhausted | Only if refactoring improves reliability |

### When to Spend vs. Save Budget

**Good reasons to spend budget:**
- Shipping valuable features
- Running experiments
- Necessary maintenance
- Learning from controlled failures

**Bad reasons to spend budget:**
- Sloppy releases
- Skipping testing
- Ignoring monitoring
- Inadequate rollback plans

The question isn't "avoid spending budget" — it's "spend budget wisely."

## Did You Know?

1. **Netflix's "Error Budget" approach is slightly different** — they focus on "disengagement" (when users leave due to problems) rather than pure availability, because some errors matter more than others.

2. **Google resets error budgets monthly** for most services, but some critical services use rolling windows (last 30 days) for smoother budget consumption curves.

3. **Some teams have "error budget loans"** — you can "borrow" from next period's budget for critical launches, but you have to "pay it back" with extra reliability work.

4. **Error budgets fundamentally changed the Dev vs Ops dynamic** at Google. Before error budgets, operations could always say "no" to releases. After, developers could say "we have budget" and release without permission—as long as they owned the consequences when budget ran out.

## War Story: The Budget That Saved the Launch

A retail company I worked with had a Black Friday problem:

**The Situation:**
- Major new feature ready for Black Friday
- Error budget at 40% (healthy, but important month)
- Feature touched payment flow (high risk)
- Leadership pressure: "Ship it!"

**Without Error Budgets (Previous Years):**
- Emotional debates: "It's risky!" "But we need it!"
- HiPPO decision (Highest Paid Person's Opinion)
- Features shipped, problems occurred, finger-pointing followed

**With Error Budgets (This Time):**

Analysis:
```
Current budget: 40% remaining
Days until Black Friday: 10
Historical: Black Friday alone usually consumes 20%

If feature causes 10% budget spend:
  Pre-Black Friday: 40% - 10% = 30%
  After Black Friday: 30% - 20% = 10%
  Buffer: 10% (uncomfortably low)

If feature causes 20% budget spend:
  Pre-Black Friday: 40% - 20% = 20%
  After Black Friday: 20% - 20% = 0%
  Buffer: NONE (SLO violation risk)
```

**The Decision:**
1. Ship feature to 10% of users (canary)
2. Monitor for 48 hours
3. If budget impact < 5%, proceed with full rollout
4. If budget impact > 5%, defer to December

**The Result:**
- Canary showed 3% budget impact
- Full rollout proceeded
- Black Friday successful
- No SLO violation
- No blame, no drama — just data

**Lesson**: Error budgets turned a political decision into a technical decision.

## Error Budget in Practice

### Scenario 1: New Feature Release

```
Before Release:
  Budget: 65%
  Feature risk: Medium (new code path)

Decision: Proceed with staged rollout

Rollout Plan:
  Stage 1: 5% traffic (1 hour)
    - Monitor error rate
    - Auto-rollback if budget drops > 5%

  Stage 2: 25% traffic (2 hours)
    - Continue monitoring
    - Human review before proceeding

  Stage 3: 100% traffic
    - Full monitoring
    - Fast rollback capability

Outcome Tracking:
  - Budget consumed by release: 2.3%
  - New budget: 62.7%
  - Decision: Good investment
```

### Scenario 2: Production Incident

```
Incident: Database connection pool exhaustion
Duration: 23 minutes
Impact: 15% of requests failed

Budget Impact:
  Before: 45%
  Consumption: 7.8%
  After: 37.2%

Actions Triggered:
  - Moved from "Healthy" to "Caution" state
  - Release cadence reduced
  - Postmortem scheduled
  - Connection pool fix prioritized

Recovery Plan:
  - Fix deployed: Expected +2% reliability
  - Budget recovery: ~5 days to return to Healthy
```

### Scenario 3: Budget Exhaustion

```
Situation:
  Budget: -3% (exhausted)
  Cause: Multiple small incidents + risky release

Freeze Policy Activated:
  1. Feature freeze immediate
  2. All releases require VP approval
  3. Team focus shifts to reliability:
     - Fix flaky tests
     - Add missing monitoring
     - Address tech debt
     - Improve rollback speed

Recovery Timeline:
  Week 1: Stabilization, budget returns to 0%
  Week 2: Conservative operations, budget at 15%
  Week 3: Limited releases, budget at 25%
  Week 4: Resume normal operations
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| No enforcement | Policy ignored when convenient | Leadership buys in, consequences real |
| Static thresholds | Same rules for all seasons | Adjust for high-traffic periods |
| Budget as punishment | Teams hide incidents | Budget is tool, not weapon |
| Ignore budget surplus | Never ship risky changes | Surplus means room to experiment |
| Reset too often | No pressure to improve | Use rolling windows |
| Too many exceptions | Policy becomes meaningless | Exceptions rare and documented |

## Quiz: Check Your Understanding

### Question 1
Your 99.9% SLO service handles 5 million requests per day over a 30-day window. How many failed requests are in your monthly error budget?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

```
Monthly requests = 5,000,000 × 30 = 150,000,000
Error budget = 150,000,000 × (1 - 0.999)
            = 150,000,000 × 0.001
            = 150,000 failed requests
```

You're allowed 150,000 failed requests per month, or about 5,000 per day.

</details>

### Question 2
You're at 20% budget remaining with 10 days left in the month. Should you ship a medium-risk feature?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Probably not**, but it depends on specifics.

Analysis:
- 20% remaining = "Critical" zone in most policies
- 10 days left = limited recovery time
- Medium risk = could consume significant budget

Considerations:
- What's the business value? Critical?
- Can it wait 10 days for budget reset?
- Can you reduce the risk (smaller scope, canary)?
- What's your rollback capability?

Default answer: Wait or reduce risk. But if business-critical and you can mitigate risk, it might be justified with approval.

</details>

### Question 3
Why should you spend error budget instead of hoarding it?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Unused error budget means:

1. **SLO is too loose**: You're over-investing in reliability users don't need
2. **Missing opportunities**: You could ship faster, experiment more
3. **Team stagnation**: No learning from controlled failures

The goal isn't zero budget consumption — it's optimal consumption. Spend budget on valuable things (features, experiments, learning), not waste it on sloppiness.

If you consistently have surplus budget, tighten your SLO.

</details>

### Question 4
A major incident consumed 30% of your error budget. What should happen next?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Depending on remaining budget:

**Immediate:**
- Assess new budget level (status change?)
- Invoke appropriate policy tier
- Schedule postmortem

**If budget critical (<25%):**
- Restrict releases
- Prioritize reliability work
- Increased monitoring

**If budget exhausted:**
- Feature freeze
- Focus entirely on reliability
- Leadership updates

**Always:**
- Blameless postmortem
- Identify prevention measures
- Update runbooks
- Track recovery to healthy budget

</details>

## Hands-On Exercise: Create an Error Budget Policy

Design an error budget policy for your organization.

### Your Task

**1. Define Your Service**

```yaml
service:
  name: # Your service
  slo_target: # e.g., 99.9%
  window: # e.g., 30 days
  criticality: # high/medium/low
```

**2. Define Budget Thresholds**

```yaml
thresholds:
  healthy:
    range: # e.g., "> 50%"
    release_policy: # What's allowed?
    on_call_stance: # How to respond?

  caution:
    range: # e.g., "25-50%"
    release_policy:
    on_call_stance:

  critical:
    range: # e.g., "5-25%"
    release_policy:
    on_call_stance:

  frozen:
    range: # e.g., "< 5%"
    release_policy:
    on_call_stance:
```

**3. Define Exceptions**

```yaml
exceptions:
  always_allowed:
    - # Security fixes?
    - # Critical bugs?

  requires_approval:
    - # Who approves exceptions?
    - # What's the process?
```

**4. Define Enforcement**

```yaml
enforcement:
  who_monitors: # Team/role responsible
  escalation_path: # Who gets notified at each level
  review_cadence: # How often to review policy
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All four threshold levels defined with clear actions
- [ ] Exceptions are specific and limited
- [ ] Enforcement mechanism is realistic
- [ ] Policy reviewed with stakeholders (or ready for review)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Error budget = 1 - SLO** — quantified acceptable unreliability
2. **Budgets balance velocity and reliability** — data replaces debate
3. **Policies must have teeth** — consequences at each threshold
4. **Spend wisely, not zero** — unused budget means loose SLO
5. **Budget is a tool, not a weapon** — enable, don't punish

## Summary

Error budgets are the mechanism that makes SLOs actionable. They:

- Quantify acceptable risk
- Enable data-driven release decisions
- Balance reliability and velocity
- Create shared ownership of reliability
- Turn debates into calculations

Without error budgets, SLOs are just numbers. With them, SLOs drive behavior.
