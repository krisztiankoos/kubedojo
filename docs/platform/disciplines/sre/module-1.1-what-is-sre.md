# Module 1.1: What is SRE?

> **Discipline Module** | Complexity: `[MEDIUM]` | Time: 30-35 min

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module:
- **Required**: [Reliability Engineering Track](../../foundations/reliability-engineering/) — Understanding failure and resilience
- **Required**: [Systems Thinking Track](../../foundations/systems-thinking/) — See systems as wholes
- **Recommended**: Some experience operating production systems
- **Recommended**: Understanding of software development lifecycle

---

## Why This Module Matters

You've learned reliability principles. Now you need a **framework** to apply them.

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is that framework. Invented at Google, adopted worldwide, SRE transforms reliability from "someone else's problem" to "everyone's measurable responsibility."

**Here's the thing**: Without SRE, reliability is:
- A vague goal ("make it more reliable")
- Someone else's job ("ops will handle it")
- In conflict with features ("we don't have time for reliability")

With SRE, reliability is:
- A measurable objective (99.9% availability)
- A shared responsibility (developers on-call)
- Balanced with velocity (error budgets)

This module shows you how SRE makes this transformation happen.

## The Origin Story

### 2003: Google's Problem

Google was growing fast. Very fast.

Traditional operations couldn't keep up:
- **Manual processes**: Too slow for Google's scale
- **Siloed teams**: Developers threw code over the wall
- **Perverse incentives**: Ops wanted stability, Dev wanted features

Ben Treynor (now Treynor Sloss) was tasked with fixing this. His solution: treat operations as a **software engineering problem**.

> "SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team."
> — Ben Treynor Sloss

### The Key Insight

Instead of hiring traditional sysadmins, Google hired software engineers and gave them operations responsibilities.

These engineers did what engineers do:
- Automated repetitive tasks
- Built tools to manage systems at scale
- Applied engineering rigor to reliability
- Measured everything

The result was **Site Reliability Engineering** — a discipline that bridges development and operations through software engineering.

---

## The SRE Mindset

### Engineering, Not Administration

Traditional ops focuses on **doing work**: patching servers, deploying code, responding to alerts.

SRE focuses on **eliminating work**: automating deployments, reducing toil, preventing incidents.

| Traditional Ops | SRE Approach |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Manual deployments | Automated CI/CD |
| Reactive firefighting | Proactive prevention |
| Tribal knowledge | Documented runbooks |
| "Keep it running" | "Make it self-healing" |
| Blame individuals | Blame systems |

### The 50% Rule

SRE teams have a hard rule: **no more than 50% of time on operational work**.

The rest goes to engineering projects that:
- Reduce future operational burden
- Improve system reliability
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Build better tools

If operational work exceeds 50%, something is wrong. Either:
- The system is too unreliable (needs reliability work)
- Too much toil exists (needs automation)
- The team is understaffed (needs hiring)

This rule ensures SRE remains an engineering discipline, not just operations with a fancy name.

### Embrace Risk (Carefully)

Here's a counterintuitive SRE principle: **100% reliability is wrong**.

Why? Because:
1. **Users can't tell**: If your service is 99.99% reliable but the user's ISP is 99% reliable, they won't notice your extra 9s
2. **It's expensive**: Each additional 9 costs exponentially more
3. **It's slow**: Extreme reliability requires extreme caution, which means slow releases

SRE embraces calculated risk through **error budgets** (more in Module 1.3).

---

## Try This: Calculate Your Users' Reliability Experience

Think about your service's path to users:

```
Your Service (99.9%)
    → Load Balancer (99.95%)
    → Internet (99.9%)
    → User's ISP (99%)
    → User's WiFi (99.5%)
    → User's Browser (99.9%)

Combined: 0.999 × 0.9995 × 0.999 × 0.99 × 0.995 × 0.999
        = ~97.3%
```

Your 99.9% doesn't matter much when users only see ~97.3%.

**Lesson**: Match your reliability to what users can actually perceive.

## SRE vs DevOps vs Platform Engineering

These terms get confused. Let's clarify:

### DevOps: A Culture

DevOps is a **cultural movement** that breaks down silos between development and operations.

Core values:
- **Collaboration**: Dev and Ops work together
- **Automation**: Reduce manual work
- **Measurement**: Track what matters
- **Sharing**: Knowledge flows freely
- **Feedback**: Fast loops everywhere

DevOps is **what you believe**.

### SRE: A Practice

SRE is a **specific implementation** of DevOps principles.

It provides:
- **Concrete practices**: SLOs, error budgets, toil reduction
- **Defined roles**: SRE teams with specific responsibilities
- **Measurable goals**: Reliability targets, not vague aspirations
- **Engineering focus**: Treat operations as software problem

SRE is **how you work**.

> "Class SRE implements interface DevOps."
> — Seth Vargo and Liz Fong-Jones

### Platform Engineering: An Approach

Platform Engineering focuses on building **internal developer platforms** that make reliability, deployment, and operations self-service.

It provides:
- **Golden paths**: Paved roads for common tasks
- **Self-service**: Developers help themselves
- **Abstraction**: Hide infrastructure complexity
- **Standardization**: Consistent patterns across teams

Platform Engineering is **what you build**.

### The Overlap

```

You can do SRE without Platform Engineering. You can do Platform Engineering without dedicated SREs. But many organizations do both, and they complement each other well.

## SRE Team Structures

There's no single way to structure SRE. Here are common models:

### Model 1: Centralized SRE Team

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Central SRE Team              │
│   (Owns reliability for all services)    │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │
    ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
    ▼             ▼             ▼
┌───────┐    ┌───────┐    ┌───────┐
│ Team A │    │ Team B │    │ Team C │
│ (Dev)  │    │ (Dev)  │    │ (Dev)  │
└───────┘    └───────┘    └───────┘
```

**Pros**:
- Consistent practices across organization
- Efficient use of specialized skills
- Clear ownership of reliability

**Cons**:
- Bottleneck for all teams
- SREs disconnected from product context
- "Throw it to SRE" mentality

**Best for**: Smaller organizations, early SRE adoption

### Model 2: Embedded SREs

```
┌───────────────────┐  ┌───────────────────┐  ┌───────────────────┐
│     Team A        │  │     Team B        │  │     Team C        │
│  ┌─────────────┐  │  │  ┌─────────────┐  │  │  ┌─────────────┐  │
│  │ Developers  │  │  │  │ Developers  │  │  │  │ Developers  │  │
│  │ + 1-2 SREs  │  │  │  │ + 1-2 SREs  │  │  │  │ + 1-2 SREs  │  │
│  └─────────────┘  │  │  └─────────────┘  │  │  └─────────────┘  │
└───────────────────┘  └───────────────────┘  └───────────────────┘
```

**Pros**:
- SREs understand product context
- Faster response to team-specific issues
- Strong collaboration with developers

**Cons**:
- Inconsistent practices across teams
- SREs can get "captured" by product work
- Less efficient (specialized skills spread thin)

**Best for**: Larger organizations, mature teams

### Model 3: Hybrid

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Central SRE Platform           │
│    (Tooling, standards, knowledge)      │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │
    ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
    ▼             ▼             ▼
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│ Team A  │  │ Team B  │  │ Team C  │
│ + SRE   │  │ + SRE   │  │ + SRE   │
└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
```

**Pros**:
- Consistent tooling and standards
- SREs have product context
- Best practices shared centrally

**Cons**:
- More complex to manage
- Potential for duplication
- Requires mature organization

**Best for**: Large organizations, scaled SRE

### Model 4: You Build It, You Run It (No Dedicated SREs)

```
┌───────────────────┐  ┌───────────────────┐  ┌───────────────────┐
│     Team A        │  │     Team B        │  │     Team C        │
│  Develops AND     │  │  Develops AND     │  │  Develops AND     │
│  Operates their   │  │  Operates their   │  │  Operates their   │
│  services         │  │  services         │  │  services         │
└───────────────────┘  └───────────────────┘  └───────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
                    ┌──────────────────┐
                    │ Enabling Team    │
                    │ (Tooling, docs)  │
                    └──────────────────┘
```

**Pros**:
- Developers fully own their services
- No "throw it over the wall"
- Deep product understanding

**Cons**:
- Not everyone wants operations work
- Inconsistent reliability practices
- Specialized skills may be lacking

**Best for**: Small organizations, high-autonomy cultures

## Did You Know?

1. **Google's SRE teams are about 50% software engineering work**. They spend half their time on automation projects that reduce future operational burden, not just keeping things running.

2. **The term "error budget" was invented at Google** to flip the conversation from "minimize all errors" to "how much error can we afford to ship features faster?"

3. **Netflix famously has no SRE team**. Instead, they practice "full-cycle developers" where each team owns their entire service lifecycle. They invest heavily in tooling to make this possible.

---

## War Story: The Team That Couldn't Scale

A startup I worked with was growing fast. Their ops team was drowning:

- 3 people handling all production for 50 developers
- On-call meant actual calls every night
- Deployment queue was 2 weeks long
- Burnout was rampant

They hired more ops people. It helped briefly, then got worse again.

**The problem**: They were scaling linearly while the system grew exponentially.

**The fix**: They adopted SRE practices:

1. **Established SLOs**: Defined what "good enough" meant
2. **Created error budgets**: Developers owned reliability
3. **Mandated toil measurement**: Found where time went
4. **Set the 50% rule**: Forced automation investment

Within 6 months:
- Deployment queue: Same day
- On-call incidents: Down 70%
- Team size: Same (3 people)
- Coverage: 100 developers

The shift wasn't hiring more people. It was **working differently**.

**Lesson**: You can't hire your way out of operational problems. You have to engineer your way out.

## SRE Principles Summary

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Reliability is a feature** | It's not separate from product development |
| **Embrace risk** | 100% is wrong; match reliability to user needs |
| **Service level objectives** | Measure reliability concretely |
| **Error budgets** | Balance reliability with velocity |
| **Toil reduction** | Automate repetitive work away |
| **Blameless postmortems** | Learn from failure without blame |
| **Engineering mindset** | Treat operations as software problem |

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| "We hired an SRE" | SRE is a practice, not a person | Adopt SRE practices org-wide |
| 100% reliability target | Expensive and slow | Set realistic SLOs based on user needs |
| SRE team does all ops | Creates bottleneck and resentment | Shared responsibility model |
| Ignoring the 50% rule | SREs become glorified ops | Protect engineering time ruthlessly |
| SRE without SLOs | No way to measure success | Define SLOs before anything else |
| Copy Google exactly | Their context isn't yours | Adapt principles to your situation |

## Quiz: Check Your Understanding

### Question 1
What distinguishes SRE from traditional operations?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**SRE treats operations as a software engineering problem**. Instead of doing operational work, SREs automate it. The 50% rule ensures SREs spend half their time on engineering projects that reduce future operational burden. SRE also brings engineering rigor through SLOs, error budgets, and blameless postmortems.

</details>

### Question 2
Why is "100% reliability" considered wrong in SRE?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Three reasons:

1. **Users can't perceive it**: Other factors (ISP, device, network) dominate user experience
2. **It's exponentially expensive**: Each additional 9 costs much more than the last
3. **It slows development**: Extreme reliability requires extreme caution

Instead, SRE embraces calculated risk through error budgets, targeting reliability levels that match user needs.

</details>

### Question 3
How do SRE, DevOps, and Platform Engineering relate?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

- **DevOps**: A cultural movement emphasizing collaboration, automation, and feedback (what you believe)
- **SRE**: A specific implementation of DevOps principles with concrete practices like SLOs and error budgets (how you work)
- **Platform Engineering**: Building internal platforms for self-service developer experience (what you build)

As Seth Vargo put it: "Class SRE implements interface DevOps."

</details>

### Question 4
What is the 50% rule and why does it matter?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

The 50% rule states that **SREs should spend no more than 50% of their time on operational work**. The rest goes to engineering projects.

It matters because:
- Ensures SRE remains an engineering discipline
- Forces automation investment
- Prevents SREs from becoming glorified ops
- Creates incentive to reduce toil

If ops work exceeds 50%, it signals systemic problems that need addressing.

*"Hope is not a strategy."* — Traditional SRE saying
