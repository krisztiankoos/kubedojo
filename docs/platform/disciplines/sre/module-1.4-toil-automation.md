# Module 1.4: Toil and Automation

> **Discipline Module** | Complexity: `[MEDIUM]` | Time: 30-35 min

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module:
- **Required**: [Module 1.1: What is SRE?](module-1.1-what-is-sre.md) — Understanding SRE fundamentals
- **Recommended**: [Systems Thinking Track](../../foundations/systems-thinking/) — Understanding system leverage
- **Helpful**: Some experience with scripting or automation

---

## Why This Module Matters

You're drowning in repetitive work. Every day:
- Reset user passwords (again)
- Restart that flaky service (again)
- Run the same diagnostic commands (again)
- Provision resources manually (again)

This work keeps the lights on, but it's eating your time. You never get to the projects that would make things better.

**This is toil.** And SRE has a systematic approach to eliminating it.

This module teaches you to identify toil, measure it, and eliminate it through automation — freeing you to work on things that actually matter.

---

## What Is Toil?

Toil is work that:
- **Manual**: Requires human hands
- **Repetitive**: Done over and over
- **Automatable**: Could be done by machines
- **Tactical**: Reactive, not strategic
- **Devoid of value**: Doesn't improve the system
- **Scales with load**: More traffic = more toil

### The Toil Test

Ask these questions about any task:

| Question | "Yes" Points to Toil |
|----------|---------------------|
| Could a script do this? | ✓ |
| Do I do this frequently? | ✓ |
| Does it require human judgment? | ✗ (not toil) |
| Does it permanently improve things? | ✗ (not toil) |
| Does it scale linearly with growth? | ✓ |
| Is it the same every time? | ✓ |

### Toil vs. Not Toil

| Task | Is It Toil? | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Restarting pods manually | Yes | Repetitive, automatable |
| Responding to pages | Depends | Investigation isn't, remediation might be |
| Writing postmortems | No | Requires judgment, creates permanent value |
| Provisioning users | Yes | Same steps each time, automatable |
| Capacity planning | No | Requires analysis and judgment |
| Running backups manually | Yes | Repetitive, should be automated |
| Designing new system | No | Creative, strategic work |

### Overhead vs. Toil

Not all operational work is toil:

**Overhead** (necessary, not toil):
- Team meetings
- Code reviews
- Planning sessions
- Training and learning
- Interviews

**Toil** (should be eliminated):
- Manual deployments
- Repetitive tickets
- Manual scaling
- Routine restarts
- Manual monitoring checks

---

## The 50% Rule

Google's SRE teams have a hard rule:

> **No more than 50% of SRE time should be spent on toil.**

The other 50%+ goes to engineering projects that:
- Reduce future toil
- Improve system reliability
- Build better tools
- Automate repetitive tasks

### Why 50%?

- **Less than 50%**: Allows toil to be addressed, not just managed
- **More than 50%**: The team becomes glorified ops, not engineers
- **Way more**: Indicates systemic problems — either too much toil or understaffed

### When Toil Exceeds 50%

If your team's toil exceeds 50%, something must change:

1. **Automate aggressively**: Invest in eliminating top toil sources
2. **Push back on service**: Service may need reliability improvements
3. **Increase staffing**: More people until automation catches up
4. **Transfer service**: Hand back to developers if too toil-heavy

The 50% rule is a **forcing function** that ensures SRE remains an engineering discipline.

## Measuring Toil

You can't reduce what you don't measure.

### Toil Measurement Framework

```yaml
toil_tracking:
  categories:
    - name: "User management"
      tasks:
        - "Password resets"
        - "Account provisioning"
        - "Access revocations"

    - name: "Incident response"
      tasks:
        - "Alert investigation"
        - "Service restarts"
        - "Failover execution"

    - name: "Deployments"
      tasks:
        - "Manual deployment steps"
        - "Rollback execution"
        - "Config updates"

    - name: "Maintenance"
      tasks:
        - "Certificate renewals"
        - "Capacity adjustments"
        - "Backup verification"

  tracking_method:
    - Tool: Time tracking software
    - Cadence: Weekly review
    - Metrics:
      - Hours per category
      - Trend over time
      - Percentage of work
```

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Toil percentage** | How much time goes to repetitive work |
| **Toil per team member** | Individual burden distribution |
| **Toil trend** | Is it getting better or worse? |
| **Toil per incident** | How much manual work per incident? |
| **Time to automate** | ROI of automation efforts |

### Simple Tracking

Start simple — a shared spreadsheet:

```
| Week | Category | Task | Time (hrs) | Automatable? |
|------|----------|------|------------|--------------|
| 1    | Users    | Password resets | 2 | Yes |
| 1    | Deploy   | Manual deploy | 4 | Yes |
| 1    | Incident | Service restart | 1 | Yes |
| 1    | Meetings | Team sync | 3 | No |
```

## Automation Strategies

### The Automation Hierarchy

Not everything should be automated the same way:

```
Level 0: Manual
   Every execution requires human action
   Example: SSH in and restart service

Level 1: Documented
   Written procedure, still manual
   Example: Runbook with exact commands

Level 2: Semi-automated
   Script exists, human triggers it
   Example: ./restart_service.sh

Level 3: Auto-triggered
   System detects need, asks permission
   Example: "Service unhealthy. Restart? [Y/n]"

Level 4: Fully automated
   System handles automatically
   Example: Kubernetes self-healing

Level 5: Self-optimizing
   System learns and improves
   Example: Auto-scaling based on patterns
```

### When to Automate

The ROI calculation:

```
Automation ROI = (Time saved per occurrence × Occurrences) - Development time

Example:
  Task: Manual deployment
  Time per deployment: 30 minutes
  Deployments per month: 40
  Automation development time: 20 hours

  Monthly savings: 40 × 0.5 hours = 20 hours
  Payback period: 20 hours / 20 hours = 1 month

  Verdict: Definitely automate
```

XKCD's classic chart helps decide:

| How often? | Time saved | Automation worth it if takes... |
|------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| 50x/day | 5 min | Up to 6 weeks |
| Daily | 5 min | Up to 4 days |
| Weekly | 5 min | Up to 1 day |
| Monthly | 30 min | Up to 4 hours |
| Yearly | 1 hour | Up to 30 minutes |

### What to Automate First

Prioritize by:

1. **High frequency, low complexity**: Quick wins
2. **High frequency, high time**: Big impact
3. **Medium everything**: Steady progress
4. **Low frequency, high complexity**: Maybe don't automate

```
                     HIGH COMPLEXITY
                          │
                    ┌─────┼─────┐
                    │  3  │  4  │
                    │     │     │
         LOW  ──────┼─────┼─────┼────── HIGH
         FREQ       │     │     │       FREQ
                    │  1  │  2  │
                    │     │     │
                    └─────┼─────┘
                          │
                     LOW COMPLEXITY

Priority order: 2 → 1 → 3 → (maybe 4)
```

## Did You Know?

1. **Google targets under 2 minutes of toil per on-call incident**. If remediation takes longer, it's a sign automation is needed.

2. **The term "toil" was deliberately chosen** by Google SREs because it implies unpleasant, grinding work — not all operational work, just the tedious kind.

3. **Some teams measure "toil velocity"** — how fast toil is increasing. A positive toil velocity is a warning sign that the system is outgrowing its automation.

## War Story: The Automation That Saved the Team

A team I worked with had a toil problem:

**The Situation:**
- 6-person SRE team
- 2 critical services
- Toil consuming 80% of time
- No time for improvements
- Team morale: terrible

**The Toil Audit:**
```
Category          | Hours/week | % of Time
------------------+------------+----------
Manual deploys    | 40         | 28%
Incident response | 35         | 24%
User provisioning | 20         | 14%
Log investigation | 15         | 10%
Certificate mgmt  | 8          | 5%
Total toil        | 118/145    | 81%
```

**The 90-Day Plan:**

Week 1-4: Automate deploys
- Built CI/CD pipeline
- Savings: 35 hours/week

Week 5-8: Auto-remediation
- Kubernetes for self-healing
- Auto-scaling policies
- Savings: 25 hours/week

Week 9-12: Self-service
- User provisioning portal
- Self-service log access
- Savings: 30 hours/week

**The Result:**
```
Before:
  Toil: 81%
  Project time: 19%
  Team morale: 2/10

After 90 days:
  Toil: 28%
  Project time: 72%
  Team morale: 8/10
```

**Key lesson**: The team wasn't bad at their jobs — they were drowning in toil. Automation gave them their time back.

## Automation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Runbook to Script

Transform documentation into code:

```bash
# Before: Runbook
# "To restart the payment service:
# 1. SSH to payment-prod
# 2. Run: sudo systemctl restart payment
# 3. Verify: curl localhost:8080/health
# 4. Check logs: tail -f /var/log/payment/app.log"

# After: Script
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Restarting payment service..."
kubectl rollout restart deployment/payment -n production

echo "Waiting for rollout..."
kubectl rollout status deployment/payment -n production

echo "Verifying health..."
kubectl exec -n production deploy/payment -- curl -s localhost:8080/health

echo "Service restarted successfully"
```

### Pattern 2: Chatbot Operations

Let chat trigger safe operations:

```
User: /restart payment-service production
Bot: ⚠️ Restart payment-service in production?
     This will cause ~30s of degraded service.
     [Confirm] [Cancel]

User: [Confirm]
Bot: ✅ Restarting payment-service...
     - Old pods terminating
     - New pods starting
     - Health check passed
     Restart complete! (took 45s)
```

### Pattern 3: Self-Healing

Let the system fix itself:

```yaml
# Kubernetes liveness probe
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
  failureThreshold: 3  # Restart after 3 failures

# Result: Kubernetes automatically restarts
# unhealthy pods — no human needed
```

### Pattern 4: Policy-Based Automation

Define policies, let systems enforce them:

```yaml
# OPA policy for auto-scaling
package autoscaling

default scale_up = false

scale_up {
    input.cpu_utilization > 80
    input.pending_requests > 100
    input.current_replicas < input.max_replicas
}

# Result: System scales up automatically
# when conditions are met
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Automate everything immediately | Wastes time on low-value automation | Prioritize by frequency × time |
| Automate before understanding | Script breaks in edge cases | Document first, understand, then automate |
| No monitoring of automation | Automated tasks fail silently | Add alerting to automation |
| Over-complex automation | Hard to maintain, breaks often | Simple, readable automation |
| Not tracking toil | Can't prove improvements | Measure before and after |
| Hero culture | Individual carries toil burden | Distribute and automate together |

## Quiz: Check Your Understanding

### Question 1
What makes something "toil" rather than regular work?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Toil is work that is:
- **Manual**: Requires human action
- **Repetitive**: Done over and over
- **Automatable**: Could be done by machines
- **Tactical**: Reactive, not strategic
- **No lasting value**: Doesn't permanently improve anything
- **Scales with load**: More growth = more toil

Key distinction: Toil doesn't require human judgment and doesn't create lasting improvement. Writing a postmortem requires judgment and creates learning — not toil. Restarting a service for the 50th time is toil.

</details>

### Question 2
Why is 50% the limit for toil?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

The 50% rule exists because:

1. **Ensures engineering time**: At least half the time goes to improvement projects
2. **Prevents ops trap**: Without the limit, toil expands to fill all time
3. **Maintains discipline**: SRE is engineering, not just operations
4. **Forces prioritization**: Must address root causes, not just symptoms

If toil exceeds 50%:
- Automate aggressively
- Push back on service quality
- Increase staffing
- Hand service back to developers

</details>

### Question 3
A task takes 15 minutes and happens twice a week. How do you decide if it's worth automating?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Calculate the ROI:

```
Weekly toil: 15 min × 2 = 30 minutes
Monthly toil: 30 min × 4 = 2 hours
Yearly toil: 2 hours × 12 = 24 hours

If automation takes 8 hours to build:
  Payback period = 8 / 2 = 4 months

Decision factors:
  - 4-month payback is reasonable
  - Consider error reduction value
  - Consider documentation value
  - Is this growing? (scaling)
```

For 2 hours/month savings, automation under 8 hours is usually worth it.

</details>

### Question 4
What's the difference between automation levels 2, 3, and 4?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Level 2: Semi-automated**
- Script exists
- Human triggers it
- Human decides when to run
- Example: `./restart_service.sh`

**Level 3: Auto-triggered**
- System detects the need
- System asks permission
- Human approves
- Example: "CPU high. Scale up? [Y/n]"

**Level 4: Fully automated**
- System detects the need
- System takes action
- No human involved
- Example: Kubernetes pod restart on probe failure

Progress: Each level reduces human involvement until humans only handle exceptions.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Toil is repetitive work that doesn't add lasting value** — identify it
2. **The 50% rule** ensures time for engineering, not just operations
3. **Measure toil** before and after — you can't improve what you don't track
4. **Prioritize automation** by frequency × time × simplicity
5. **Progress through automation levels** — from manual to self-healing

## Summary

Toil is the repetitive, automatable work that eats your time without making things better. Left unchecked, it consumes all your time and prevents improvement.

SRE's approach:
- **Measure** toil systematically
- **Limit** toil to 50% of time
- **Automate** strategically (ROI-based)
- **Progress** through automation levels

The goal isn't to eliminate all operational work — it's to eliminate the grinding, repetitive parts so you can focus on work that matters.
