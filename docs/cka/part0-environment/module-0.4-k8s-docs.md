## Why This Module Matters

During the CKA exam, you have access to:
- **kubernetes.io/docs**
- **kubernetes.io/blog**
- **helm.sh/docs** (for Helm)
- **github.com/kubernetes** (for reference)

This is open-book. You don't need to memorize YAML schemas. But if you spend 3 minutes searching for a NetworkPolicy example, you've wasted half your question time.

This module teaches you where everything is—so you can find it in seconds.

> **The Library Analogy**
>
> Imagine you need a specific recipe from a library. You could wander the aisles hoping to stumble upon it. Or you could know that cookbooks are in section 641.5, third shelf from the top. The kubernetes.io docs are your library. Wandering wastes time. Knowing the sections—Tasks for how-to, Reference for specs, Concepts for theory—is your Dewey Decimal System. This module gives you the map.

> **War Story: The Search That Cost 8 Points**
>
> A candidate needed a NetworkPolicy example during their CKA. They typed "network policy" in the search bar and got dozens of results. They clicked through Concepts first (wrong—theory, no examples), then a blog post (interesting but not what they needed), then finally found the Tasks page. Total time: 4 minutes. They ran out of time on the last question. Later they learned: Tasks → Administer Cluster → Declare Network Policy. That's a 15-second lookup if you know the path.

## Part 1: Documentation Structure

The Kubernetes documentation has a predictable structure:

```
kubernetes.io/docs/
├── concepts/           ← Theory, how things work
├── tasks/              ← Step-by-step HOW-TO guides
├── reference/          ← API specs, kubectl, glossary
└── tutorials/          ← End-to-end walkthroughs
```

### What You'll Use in the Exam

| Section | Use For | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Tasks** | How to DO something | "Configure a Pod to Use a ConfigMap" |
| **Reference** | YAML fields, kubectl flags | "kubectl Cheat Sheet" |
| **Concepts** | Understanding (rarely during exam) | "What is a Service?" |

**Tasks** is your primary destination during the exam.

## Part 3: Search Strategy

The built-in search works, but it's often faster to know where things are.

### Strategy 1: Use the Search Bar

1. Press `/` or click the search icon
2. Type keywords: "networkpolicy example"
3. Look for **Tasks** results first

### Strategy 2: Go Directly to Tasks

Most exam answers are in Tasks:

```
kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/
├── Administer a Cluster/
│   ├── Network Policies
│   ├── Using RBAC Authorization
│   └── Manage Resources
├── Configure Pods and Containers/
│   ├── Configure a Pod to Use a ConfigMap
│   ├── Configure a Pod to Use a Secret
│   └── Configure a Pod to Use a PersistentVolume
├── Access Applications in a Cluster/
│   └── Set up Ingress on Minikube with NGINX
└── Run Applications/
    └── Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
```

### Strategy 3: kubectl explain

Faster than any website:

```bash
# See available fields for a resource
k explain pod.spec.containers

# Go deeper
k explain pod.spec.containers.resources
k explain pod.spec.containers.volumeMounts

# See all fields at once
k explain pod --recursive | grep -A5 "containers"
```

This works offline and shows exactly what fields are available.

---

## Part 4: Finding YAML Examples

### Pattern: Every Task Has Examples

When you find a task page, scroll down. There's almost always a copyable YAML example.

Example: "Configure a Pod to Use a ConfigMap"
- Scroll to "Define container environment variables using ConfigMap data"
- Copy the YAML
- Modify for your needs

### Pattern: Look for "What's next" Section

At the bottom of pages, "What's next" links to related tasks. If you're close but not quite right, check these links.

### Pattern: API Reference for Field Details

Need to know all PVC accessModes?

```
kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/
├── Workload Resources/
├── Service Resources/
├── Config and Storage Resources/
│   └── PersistentVolumeClaim
└── ...
```

Or faster:
```bash
k explain pvc.spec.accessModes
```

---

## Part 5: Quick Reference Locations

### NetworkPolicy

**Location**: Tasks → Administer a Cluster → Declare Network Policy

**Direct URL**: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/declare-network-policy/

**Key Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-network-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 6379
```

### PersistentVolumeClaim

**Location**: Tasks → Configure Pods → Configure a Pod to Use a PersistentVolumeClaim

**Key Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

### RBAC (Role + RoleBinding)

**Location**: Tasks → Administer a Cluster → Using RBAC Authorization

**Key Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: jane
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### Ingress

**Location**: Concepts → Services, Load Balancing → Ingress

**Key Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

### Gateway API (New in 2025)

**Location**: Concepts → Services, Load Balancing → Gateway API

**Key Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: http-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: my-gateway
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /app
    backendRefs:
    - name: my-service
      port: 80
```

## Did You Know?

- **The exam browser has limited tabs**. You can't open 20 tabs like normal browsing. Learn to navigate efficiently with fewer tabs.

- **kubernetes.io search is decent but not great**. Sometimes Google would be better, but you can't use it in the exam. Practice using the native search.

- **`kubectl explain` doesn't need internet**. It reads from your cluster's API server. This is often faster than searching documentation.

- **Blog posts are allowed** (kubernetes.io/blog). Some complex topics have excellent blog explanations. But Tasks is usually faster for "how do I do X."

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Searching too broadly | Too many results | Use specific terms: "networkpolicy ingress example" |
| Reading concepts during exam | Wastes time | Go straight to Tasks |
| Memorizing YAML | Unnecessary | Know WHERE to find examples |
| Not using kubectl explain | Slow | `k explain` is instant |
| Opening too many tabs | Browser slows down | Close tabs you're done with |
