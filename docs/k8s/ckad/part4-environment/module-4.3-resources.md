# Module 4.3: Resource Requirements and Limits

> **Complexity**: `[MEDIUM]` - Critical for production, affects scheduling
>
> **Time to Complete**: 35-45 minutes
>
> **Prerequisites**: Module 1.1 (Pods), understanding of CPU and memory concepts

## Why This Module Matters

Resource requests and limits control how much CPU and memory your containers can use. Without them, a single container could consume all node resources, starving other pods. Proper resource management is essential for cluster stability.

The CKAD exam tests:
- Setting requests and limits
- Understanding the difference between them
- What happens when limits are exceeded
- LimitRanges and ResourceQuotas

> **The Apartment Lease Analogy**
>
> Resource requests are like a guaranteed parking spot—you're assured that space. Limits are like the building's max occupancy—you can use more space temporarily, but there's a hard cap. If you exceed it (memory), you get evicted (OOMKilled). If the building is full (node), new tenants (pods) wait until space opens.

## Requests vs Limits

### Definitions

| Term | Meaning | When Enforced |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Request** | Guaranteed minimum resources | Scheduling time |
| **Limit** | Maximum allowed resources | Runtime |

### How They Work

## Setting Resources

### Basic Syntax

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "256Mi"
        cpu: "100m"
      limits:
        memory: "512Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

### Units

**CPU:**
| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `1` | 1 CPU core |
| `1000m` | 1000 millicores = 1 core |
| `500m` | 0.5 cores |
| `100m` | 0.1 cores (10%) |

**Memory:**
| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `128Mi` | 128 mebibytes (1024-based) |
| `1Gi` | 1 gibibyte = 1024 Mi |
| `128M` | 128 megabytes (1000-based) |
| `1G` | 1 gigabyte = 1000 M |

---

## What Happens at Limits

### Memory Limit Exceeded

```
Container uses > limit → OOMKilled → Container restarts
```

```bash
# Check if pod was OOMKilled
k describe pod my-pod | grep -A5 "Last State"
k get pod my-pod -o jsonpath='{.status.containerStatuses[0].lastState}'
```

### CPU Limit Exceeded

```
Container uses > limit → Throttled (slowed down, NOT killed)
```

CPU throttling is invisible to the container—it just runs slower.

---

## QoS Classes

Kubernetes assigns Quality of Service classes based on resource settings:

| QoS Class | Condition | Eviction Priority |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Guaranteed** | Requests = Limits for all containers | Last (protected) |
| **Burstable** | Requests < Limits (or only one set) | Middle |
| **BestEffort** | No requests or limits set | First (evicted first) |

### Guaranteed Example

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "256Mi"    # Same as request
    cpu: "100m"        # Same as request
```

### Burstable Example

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"    # Higher than request
    cpu: "500m"        # Higher than request
```

### BestEffort Example

```yaml
resources: {}  # No resources defined
```

---

## Scheduling Impact

### Pod Won't Schedule

If no node has enough **available** resources (capacity - allocated requests):

```bash
# Check why pod is Pending
k describe pod my-pod

# Events will show:
# 0/3 nodes are available: 3 Insufficient cpu.
# or
# 0/3 nodes are available: 3 Insufficient memory.
```

### Check Node Capacity

```bash
# Node capacity and allocatable
k describe node NODE_NAME | grep -A5 Capacity
k describe node NODE_NAME | grep -A5 Allocatable

# Already allocated
k describe node NODE_NAME | grep -A10 "Allocated resources"
```

---

## LimitRange

Namespace-level defaults and constraints:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: cpu-memory-limits
spec:
  limits:
  - default:          # Default limits if not specified
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "512Mi"
    defaultRequest:   # Default requests if not specified
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "256Mi"
    max:              # Maximum allowed
      cpu: "2"
      memory: "2Gi"
    min:              # Minimum allowed
      cpu: "50m"
      memory: "64Mi"
    type: Container
```

```bash
# View LimitRange
k get limitrange
k describe limitrange cpu-memory-limits
```

---

## ResourceQuota

Namespace-level total resource limits:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: compute-quota
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "4"
    requests.memory: "8Gi"
    limits.cpu: "8"
    limits.memory: "16Gi"
    pods: "10"
```

```bash
# View quota usage
k get resourcequota
k describe resourcequota compute-quota
```

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Set resources in pod spec
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "256Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"

# Check pod resources
k get pod POD -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].resources}'

# Check node capacity
k describe node NODE | grep -A10 "Allocated"

# Check QoS class
k get pod POD -o jsonpath='{.status.qosClass}'
```

---

## Did You Know?

- **CPU is compressible, memory is not.** If you exceed CPU limits, you're throttled. If you exceed memory limits, you're killed.

- **Requests affect scheduling, limits affect runtime.** A pod with 1Gi memory request won't schedule on a node with only 512Mi available, even if the container only uses 100Mi.

- **Kubernetes doesn't prevent memory overcommit.** If all pods burst to their limits simultaneously, the node runs out of memory and starts killing pods.

- **The `cpu: 0.1` syntax** is equivalent to `cpu: 100m` (100 millicores).

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| No resources set | BestEffort pods evicted first | Always set requests |
| Request > Limit | Invalid, rejected | Request must be ≤ Limit |
| Memory too low | OOMKilled constantly | Profile app, increase limits |
| CPU too low | App runs slowly | Monitor with `k top`, adjust |
| Same as node capacity | No room for system pods | Leave headroom |

## Quiz

1. **What's the difference between requests and limits?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   Requests are guaranteed resources used for scheduling decisions. Limits are maximum allowed resources enforced at runtime. Requests must be ≤ Limits.
   </details>

2. **What happens when a container exceeds its memory limit?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   The container is OOMKilled (terminated) and may be restarted depending on the restart policy.
   </details>

3. **What happens when a container exceeds its CPU limit?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   The container is throttled (slowed down) but NOT killed. CPU is compressible.
   </details>

4. **What QoS class does a pod get if requests equal limits?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   Guaranteed. This is the highest priority class and pods are evicted last.
   </details>

## Hands-On Exercise

**Task**: Configure and observe resource behavior.

**Part 1: Basic Resources**
```bash
cat << 'EOF' | k apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "50m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "100m"
EOF

# Check QoS class
k get pod resource-demo -o jsonpath='{.status.qosClass}'
echo

# Check resources
k get pod resource-demo -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].resources}'
```

**Part 2: OOMKill Demo**
```bash
cat << 'EOF' | k apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: memory-hog
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: polinux/stress
    command: ["stress"]
    args: ["--vm", "1", "--vm-bytes", "200M", "--vm-hang", "1"]
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "100Mi"
EOF

# Watch it get OOMKilled
k get pod memory-hog -w

# Check reason
k describe pod memory-hog | grep -A3 "Last State"
```

**Cleanup:**
```bash
k delete pod resource-demo memory-hog
```
