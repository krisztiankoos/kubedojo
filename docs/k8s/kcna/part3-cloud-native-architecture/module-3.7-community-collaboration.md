# Module 3.7: Cloud Native Community & Collaboration

> **Complexity**: `[QUICK]` - Awareness and etiquette
>
> **Time to Complete**: 10-15 minutes
>
> **Prerequisites**: Modules 3.1–3.6 (Cloud Native Architecture)

## Outline
- How CNCF and Kubernetes are governed
- Where work happens (SIGs, WGs, repos)
- How to contribute responsibly
- Mental model: an open-source city—SIGs are neighborhoods, KEPs are planning permits, and PRs are building permits reviewed in public.
- First-visit plan: observe, then help a neighbor fix a small sign (docs/typo) before proposing a new building.

---

## Governance at a Glance
- **CNCF** hosts Kubernetes as a graduated project; neutral home, vendor-diverse.
- **Kubernetes project** is organized by **SIGs** (Special Interest Groups) and **WGs** (Working Groups) that own areas (e.g., SIG-Network, SIG-Auth).
- **KEPs** (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals) track larger changes; design happens in issues/PRs with community review.

## Where to Engage
- SIG meetings (public calendars), mailing lists, Slack channels (`slack.k8s.io`), GitHub issues/PRs.
- CNCF landscape: many projects follow similar models (maintainers, reviewers, contributors).
- Upstream etiquette: be clear, reproducible, and respectful; follow contributor guides in each repo.

## Contribution Basics
- Start small: docs fixes, issue triage, test flake investigations.
- Use **good reports**: include K8s version, environment, repro steps, expected vs. actual behavior.
- For PRs: follow repository coding/contribution guides, add tests when changing behavior, and respond to reviewer feedback promptly.

> **Why KCNA cares**: Understanding community norms helps you navigate docs, report issues effectively, and grow into deeper contributions.

> **Tip**: Lurk first. Watch a SIG meeting or review a few PR threads to learn tone and expectations before jumping in.
