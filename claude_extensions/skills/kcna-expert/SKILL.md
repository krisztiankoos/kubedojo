| Format | Multiple choice | Hands-on |
| Difficulty | Entry level | Professional |
| Focus | Concepts | Implementation |
| Duration | 90 min | 120 min |
| Prerequisites | None | None |

## Study Approach

Different from hands-on exams:
- **Concept understanding** over command memorization
- **CNCF landscape** awareness
- **Cloud native principles** (12-factor, microservices)
- **Vocabulary** and terminology

## Exam Strategy

For multiple choice:
1. **Eliminate obviously wrong answers** first
2. **Flag uncertain questions** for review
3. **Watch for "all of the above"** patterns
4. **Read carefully** - subtle wording matters
